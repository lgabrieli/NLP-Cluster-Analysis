True,NoMoreNicksLeft,,,"This doesn't sum up the opposition in any way, shape, or form.

I am opposed to any of the proposed ""progressive"" reforms (be it single payer, the public option, or the mess we're about to get) on many grounds.

As a nation, we can't afford it. Now, I know all the bad math and handwaving that goes on... but it's flawed. And even if it weren't, it conflates the sum total of what individuals are paying now, and what the revenue of the nation is. The two are not the same.

I am opposed even if we can afford it, because adults are supposed to take care of themselves, and this is a good thing. It's not something they can do when it's easy, but then go whining to government when it is difficult... if you only do adult things when it is easy, you are not an adult. The lack of personal responsibility this would cultivate is sickening.

If you designed your ""systems"" so that it would still be possible for me to do as I wish, that would be one thing. But you threaten to take another slice of my paycheck for this, and on top of that some of the proposals would make it impossible to find any qualified health care workers whom I could pay for care. They'd all be government employees, directly or indirectly. I can barely afford my care as is, I can't be flying my kid to India to get her vaccinations.

Additionally, you're setting people up to be even more dependent on the state. What happens if or when things really fall apart? They'll be even more incapable.

Finally, the problem is insurance. You can't fix it by creating even bigger (government) insurance, changing insurance, or adding to it. You don't even understand the problem. In a nation where no one had insurance (either because they chose not to pay the premiums, or it was disallowed) medical prices would be orders of magnitude cheaper. Coupled with the supposedly many thousands per year that people pay for premiums, that would make it possible for everyone to care for themselves.",0,1262409677,,0,False,0,c0i2scg,t3_akmiy,t1_c0i2scg,t1_c0i2j5d,,1426172360,-10,False,politics,t5_2cneq,-10
True,NoMoreNicksLeft,,,"&gt; Would you support turning health insurance companies into non profits?

It's not about the profit. Anyone that sees their profit would be a fool to think that this will change things... 6% tops? Would you be ok if your bills were lowered by 6%, your premiums? Would just a few thousand fewer claim denials be enough for you to be ok?

I mean, if you want to turn them into non-profits, it doesn't bother me. Go ahead. I don't want insurance, and I choose to go without it. As long as you don't force me to buy it, I don't give a shit. But that's the rub, isn't it? You won't let me.

&gt; What if you're just starting out at your job and you get an expensive illness like cancer?

Then I die. This is going to happen no matter what, I understand this and accept it. But however much I have left, I'd like to live my life as independently and responsibly as possible.

&gt; That's why we have insurance.

No, you don't even know why you have insurance. You have it because everyone else has it and they mindlessly harp on you that you need it if you ever consider that maybe you don't. You let their nagging terrorize you, and then, quite after the fact, you rationalize it... as you do about many parts of the status quo (all of them, in fact, that don't happen to be unfashionable among your clique/subculture).

If you wanted to spread risk sensibly, you and all your extended family would be saving every red cent you got, no insurance, and pooling your money among each other. 4-6 earners who would otherwise be spending $12,000 per year on premiums would have a pool well above $1million. And the only people who could deny the claim would be those who love you the most, instead of strangers.

&gt; It's the definition of insurance.

Actually, insurance pays for expensive, unlikely things. If you're going by the definition, why the fuck are you retards using it for doctor's visits and routine things? Why vaccinations for your children and so forth?

You don't even understand the problem, yet you insist you know what the solution is... and your proof should anyone ask for it is ""because everyone else agrees with me"".",0,1262414503,,0,False,0,c0i2w25,t3_akmiy,t1_c0i2w25,t1_c0i2ujq,,1426172408,-9,False,politics,t5_2cneq,-9
True,sockpuppetzero,,,"So,  how do we organize?   What's the *raison d'Ãªtre* for a social movement that Matt Taibbi spoke of?   Part of the problem with organizing the left is that we tend to bring too many issues to the table,  and that inevitable disagreements tend to cause division and diffusion instead of spirited debate and further collaboration.

A few comments of the way I see the world:

1.  Science:   *real* science should be a core value of any given movement.   Unfortunately you have a lot of anti-vax and self-styled environmental idiots running around proclaiming themselves liberal leaders. 

2.  Environmentalism:    I care very much about the environment.   Unfortunately,  environmentalism has a deserved and undeserved reputation for being the movement of ""no"".  More disturbingly,  I see a close-mindedness and anti-intellectualism,  often discarding science in order to tow the ""party line"".   Taking a reasonably complete account of the benefits and risks of any given technology is generally not done.   

    A. support for nuclear power:   the specific power density of nukes and the specific energy of nuclear fuels is phenomenal.   The mining footprint is relatively small and the technology has a rather unique advantage of leaving almost all of the pollution in one place.    Due to thermodynamics,  breeder reactors are a must;  fast plutonium breeders have some messy safety issues,   thermal u-233 breeders (i.e. thorium) seem much more realistic. 

   B. Proper accounting for biofuels:   In the long run,  I'm optimistic about the possibilities for biofuels.    However,  I think our current efforts are profoundly misguided,  causing rainforest destruction and food insecurity due to increased demand for grains.

   C.  Wind and solar are considered by many environmentalists the only two ""acceptable"" technologies,  which is misguided.    They are ok,  but it's not all puppies and babies.   Wind in particular requires a lot of concrete and steel, and has low power densities.   Solar has the potential for lower capital costs,  but the power densities are still rather low.    More to the point,  while I believe they could provide half of our electrical needs,  it's completely unrealistic for them to be a complete energy solution.  

3.  Social sanity.    Let's take back the words ""socialism"" and ""liberal"",  and offer a unified front against xenophobia and homophobia.  Racism and sexism aren't exactly solved problems,  but they aren't primary issues anymore.  

4.   Electoral reform:   Condorcet voting or approval voting FTW!   Instant runoff and plurality voting FTL!  

5.   Educational reform:   We need to repeal NCLB,  and we need a new new math effort based around statistics and computer science and de-emphasizing calculus.

That said,  we shouldn't put down the netroots as a movement too much.   Part of the problem is that much of the ""action"" happens online,  and doesn't get more widespread recognition,  except to lambaste and demonize it.   The question really is,  how do we focus our message,  to amplify it,  and to turn it into action IRL?",0,1262517665,,0,True,0,c0i4tg1,t3_akyt0,t1_c0i4tg1,t3_akyt0,,1426173309,4,False,politics,t5_2cneq,4
True,bvanmidd,,,"&gt;Chances have nothing to do with it. Security/precautionary measures are always 100% compared to a much lesser chance of something bad happening. We get shots so that we won't get a rare disease. We wear seatbelts every time we drive because there's a slight chance that that one particular drive will be the one in a million time that we get into an accident. ""It doesn't happen very often"" isn't any reason not to prevent against it. I don't know about you, but I've been taught ways to avoid getting struck by lightning.

Forgive my outburst, but

***AAAAAAHHHHHHHH***

It's called risk management. We don't just do everything because it might prevent something bad. We look at the costs.

Cars crash frequently enough that it is expected for each individual in America to experience at least 1 car crash in their lifetimes. It isn't 1 in a million. The cost to include a seatbelt in every vehicle in America is nominal to the costs in property and personal injury damage.

Shots, or rather vaccines, are effective in stopping viruses. They are our only protection against them. Here, it is a matter of doing something, or catching rubella. The cost of the vaccine is small in comparison to getting the measles.

To be an efficient use of tax dollars, scanners need to significantly reduce the occurrences of bombs blowing up planes and killing people. Whether that's enough to cover the cost of the machine, or half that cost, is up to the decision makers.

Given that the chances of plane bombings are so low, there is NO prediction for the scanners to prevent bombings. There is no prediction to preventing the next 9/11.

True,rz2000,,,"The operating principle behind this argument is that a catastrophic pandemic cannot occur. The reason people believe this is because they have not experienced a global pandemic within their lifetimes. We are notoriously bad at understanding risk.

Additionally people are likely to point to numbers for tragic diseases such as malaria or point out that over 1 million children die each year from diarrhea from poor water supplies. The third world could use more resources for clean water and mosquito nets. However the numbers do not displace eachother, and a few million added to these numbers would be significantly traumatic to rich and poor countries. the 100-200 million of a worst case scenario, might lead to a complete breakdown of trade and many famines around the world.

We will never know if the pandemic would have become more severe if the vaccine had not prevented the vectors necessary for it to spread more rapidly or even evolve into a more dangerous pathogen.

We have such obvious examples of the unexpected occurring over the past 10 years that I am frankly surprised at the number of commenters here who claim that ""common sense"" was a good guide for analyzing the risk level of unlikely events, or who congratulate themselves on putting two and two together despite a lack of any training or education.

Auto accidents are extremely rare in the context of the number of car rides you will take in your life. That does not mean that you are smart if you complete a trip safely and were not wearing a seatbelt. 

Similarly, you always see the people congratulating themselves for not having evacuated in front of a hurricane that ended up sparing their town. While it is easy for an outsider to see that these people are fools, and had less information to base their decisions than meteorologists advising them to to flee, they really are proud of themselves and think that they are wise.

It is also worth pointing out that it was common sense that lead people who saw fish flopping around, where the sea had just receded, to think it was probably a pretty cool thing to go check out. If you've never experienced a tsunami, how could you imagine something so foreign to your personal experiences. 

Considering the tsunamis it would have been helpful if some of the less developed communities had strong superstitions about the sea receding.

True,brufleth,,,"Well the point he's making is a little misleading.  Sure the regular flu might kill more due to secondary infections.  It might even take more directly simply because of how many it infects.  Swine flu has (or at least could have potentially had) a much higher mortality rate due directly to the virus itself.  It is the difference between a deadly flu that will actually kill you and a more typical flu that just makes you more likely to get a secondary infection.

Ultimately I kind of agree with him on this though.  Flu vaccines are largely a means for drug companies to fleece the population.  They _might_ be helpful for high risk groups but many (maybe even most) people getting them don't really need them and will still get other bad colds over the course of the season anyway.

In the US we have evacuations in front of hurricanes. When should people be compelled to leave their homes? I think it would be reckless to stay if you had a four in five chance of surviving, yet even those odds give four people who don't understand unlikely events the chance to proclaim their wisdom after the fact.

With a hurricane people have to make the decision at a time that the local weather does not seem very threatening. 
Not everyone is equipped to make decisions with information, and they won't leave unless they are afraid. They may need to visualize the potential destruction, and unfortunately for them the abstraction of television images or weather forecasts is not enough. They end up waiting until the weather really does sour and then it is often too late.

It will be the exact same with a pandemic. If the vaccine takes months to produce manufacturers need to predict the number of doses that should be manufactured. Likewise if the vaccine takes a couple weeks to be effective, an attitude of waiting until it looks serious is very foolish. With geometric rates of infection the more people who chose to wait, the more panic there will be as doses need to be reallocated around the country and staffing needs to be hired. Furthermore all of those people who chose to skip vaccinations when they weren't personally scared will be the primary vectors in any outbreak.

It should be possible to make preparations without panic. Considering that literacy rates are well above 90%, people should also be able to understand abstract ideas like threats they have not experienced within their lifetime.

True,[deleted],,,"""Limited government"" is a joke.

I woke up in the morning in my FHA (Federal Housing Administration) approved home that was built in accordance with USDOE (Department of Energy), FERC (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission), and numerous CFRs (Code of Federal Regulations).

I went to the bathroom to clean up for work. I showered with soap, shampoo and other toiletry products that have been approved for me by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) using water that meets federal EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) quality standards.

I took my morning vitamins which had to be approved by the FDA.

I went downstairs to eat breakfast foods that had to be approved by the FDA and listened to my morning radio programs which are regulated by the FCC (Federal Communication Commission).

I then got into my EPA and DOT (Dept. of Transportation) standards approved and FTC (Federal Trade Commission) regulated car and was forced by the NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) to buckle my seatbelt and put my daughter into an approved child seat. I then drove on DOT regulated roads and was forced to drive a certain speed while listening to more FCC approved programming on my radio.

I stopped for gas but there wasnât any due to state legislated gas quality restrictions which caused a decrease in the supply of gas and also gasoline price controls that kept the price so artificially low that there was an excess demand such that it sold out as soon as it arrived.

I arrived at my DOL (Dept. of Labor) regulated and EEOC (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) sanctioned place of employment, running on fumes, and was forced to work the first 2 hours of my 8 hour shift for the federal and state governments by giving almost 30% of my wages to the IRS and SSA (Social Security Administration) with no compensation.

At lunchtime I went with colleagues to eat and was forced to pay with the only medium of exchange the government approves that is regulated by the FRB (Federal Reserve Board): worthless fiat bank notes.

I then went to pick up my daughter from school where sheâs learning a DOE (Dept. of Education) approved curriculum. I took her to an HMO (Health Maintenance Organization) approved doctor to get her HHS (Health and Human Services) mandated vaccinations that I learned she needed while watching a Disney family movie which was interrupted by an HHS PSA.

After returning to work I checked my SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) and IRS regulated investments in my now Federal Treasury owned banks to see if Iâll be able to retire someday since the SSA trust fund that Iâve been paying into for 25 years has been raided by the federal government and is now bankrupt.

That afternoon I had to catch a flight to our office in Detroit aboard an FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) approved plane operating at an FAA regulated airport.

Before boarding I had to pass through a TSA (Transportation Safety Administration) security checkpoint where I was forced to disrobe down to my shirt, pants and socks and pass through a scanning machine that saw right through my remaining clothing.

Onboard I noticed federal sky marshals with weapons so I decided to have a cocktail composed of liquor that is controlled by the ATF (Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms), as are the sky marshalâs guns.

Once sufficiently sedated with bourbon, I sat back and relaxed and thought to myself: Thank God I donât live in a country where the government controls your life!

It sounds like you don't realize that there isn't just 1 strain of seasonal flu, or even 1 strain of seasonal flu *per year*.  There are many.  H1N1 can be considered a name-brand strain - the others didn't rise to celebrity status.

Check out [this chart (the table below US Virologic Surveillance)](http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/), which breaks down the incidence of flu in 2009.  You'll see that the majority of identified flu cases in the CDC study were H1N1.

This season, the most prevalent type of flu was H1N1.

Estimates suggest that H1N1 will be a key player in the 2010 flu season as well, though it is of course expected that new strains will be identified and included in the cocktail of next year's seasonal flu shot.

The reason that H1N1 had a separate inoculation was that it was developed in a hurry.  It wasn't pre-empted in the same way that most recent seasonal flu strains have been in recent years.

Next year, the H1N1 vaccine will just be part of the regular seasonal flu vaccine, and we'll be back to normalcy.

True,crazydave333,,,"I think global warming is real and that carbon emissions are to blame. However, I am skeptical of many of the solutions that are being proposed. Carbon offset credits look like a scam to me. Cap and trade might be a good idea in theory, but in practice will likely be a disaster. Even if the US reduces its carbon output, we can't reasonably get the rest of the world to follow suit. I am pessimistic about our ability to cut carbon emissions world wide since the world population is constantly expanding and beginning to desire an American standard of living.

While research into cutting carbon emissions should continue, I think we also need to plan for a future where global temperatures are higher and to research technologies that mitigate that effect. Things like improving water desalination and new farming techniques would go a long way to improving the standard of living for people on a warmer planet. There is no magic bullet to make a clean burning car (though we should work towards making cleaner cars). Rethinking urban planning for higher population densities and growing food inside of cities would yield greater results.

The big problem is that since the science is becoming politicized, each side is devolving into dogma. Ideas that could mitigate the effects of global warming are often dismissed because it doesn't solve the underlying problem and allows people to continue their lifestyle. To me, that it the equivalent of religious fundamentalists blocking the release of HPV vaccines because it would encourage women to have premarital sex if they didn't run the risk of cervical cancer.

Yes!  Newborns who are circumcised without an anesthetic experience true pain.

Circumcision is surgery on a very sensitive part of the body.  **Research suggests that boys who were circumcised without any anesthetic experience more trauma (pain and fear) with each of their many routine childhood vaccines.**  Fortunately, many local pain-killers are now used for circumcision.

A review of the research concludes that DPNB is the most effective treatment for preventing circumcision pain [10].

True,DiscursiveMind,,,"I've got a slightly different perspective on this topic. What concerns me more than humanity using up the global resource pool is the rapid overreaching of the promoted ""antiseptic"" lifestyle. 

What I mean by this is? In only few generations we have moved from a species that had to deal with parasites and microbes just like every other species, to one that desires as squeaky clean lifestyle devoid off all things ""icky"". We've become a society that put antibiotics in window cleaners for F* sake. So we've taken a reactive immune system battle with these elements to a proactive battle outside the body, what's the harm in that. Well I would say none, if it was handled properly, but that isn't the case. We have uneducated segments public who are abusing antibiotics through overuse and/or improper use. Super-bugs like MRSA and GAS are out there in part due to misuse of antibiotics.

So we've got an increasingly army of nasty microbes out there, that is half of my concern. The second half is the erosion of progress we have made against previously devastating illnesses and diseases due to vaccination. Thanks again to ignorance and fear, heard immunity has probably been lost on several diseases like mumps and whooping cough. When you couple these things together, humanity has a couple of juggernauts lurking out there that could cause serious damage.

This brings me back to overpopulation. If taken from the pathogen's perspective, humanity is the great untapped resource. In the case for most overpopulations for other species, if one group grows too large, another factor usually comes into the picture to balance out the equation. For humanity, we've become particularly adept at fighting off elements that would look to do this same sequence to us.

I feel that our total population, and the shear number of human's living in beyond sub-standard conditions; we've not only become the lush green field on the other side of the fence, we've left some of the gates open to that field.

To get to the heart of it, my concern with overpopulation is that we've become a very ripe target for a global pandemic.

How are we going to get food from where it's grown to where the people are?  Currently, OIL.  

And oil is central to a lot of the problem, but it's still only a part, that would include pollution from energy production, from human waste, farm waste.

&gt;Stabilizing world population is a natural byproduct of higher living standards, as has been proven by the stabilization of the white population in the west.

Forgets to mention that the higher living standards is a product of a huge increase in energy consumption, do you mean that the current 3rd world population is going to stabilize at something only marginally larger than what it is now... by increasing the energy consumption many fold?

&gt;being fed through a tube in his nose [...]

and, of course, the handful of reported deaths.

Please don't get me wrong here. I don't revel in the idea of being sick... not for me, not for anyone. But...


I also have a long-time friend who subscribes lock, stock, and barrel to the notion of ""beneficial herd immunity"", and that anyone who *doesn't* get vaccinated is a traitor to their own community. Anyone who doesn't voluntarily get in line to have a foreign substance (99% unnecessarily) injected into their body should be cast out of their community, and said community should actively make a public example of such villains.

Ironically, he's one of the most liberal thinking people I know, but in this area... he's bought and sold conservative corporate pharmaceutical propaganda through and through.

A king who lived in the year 778 might greatly disagree that the average american life is better than his was.

This has to be one of the stupidest things  I have ever read.  Yes life is better because we have cell phones and TV's and the computers and the internet!  The advances in medicine alone make life significantly better than it was even 50 years ago.  MRI's, Chemotherapy, new drugs and vaccinations have elimated what used to debilitating and deadly diseases. 

Also, nicely done treating life expectancy with such a cavalier attitude.  I think that the king in 778 would probably prefer to live to be 75 in our current time rather than the expected 30 of his own time.

You seem to think that since we haven't progressed to a time where there is no slavery, racism, wars, or poverty that we haven't advanced.  That's simply not true.  Yes there is certainly more work to do but we live in today the most properous, technological advanced, conflict free time that has ever existed on the planet.

Oh and one more thing...

&gt;    The important thing is that the prevalence of slavery is less today than in the past.
&gt;absolutely not true.

Actually this is absolutely true.  There are an esimated 27 million slaves today and 12 million people who live in forced labour.  (Source: Wikipedia)  That's a total of 39 million but since I'm sure you'll say that those esimates are too low let's double them.  That's 68 million slaves worldwide today.  Given that the earths population is 6.8 billion that means only 1% is a slave.  Let's compare that to Rome where estimates range anywhere from 10% to 40% of the population was a slave.

True,themightymekon,,,"Healthcare bill facts:
The biggest changes in the proposed health reform legislation wouldn't take place until 2014. That's when the health insurance mandate kicks in, along with the tax credits and health-insurance marketplace changes that make it all work.

But some things will happen immediately, or nearly so, if health reform is signed into law:

    * Help for young adults. Young adults will be able to stay on their parents' individual or group policies until their 26th birthdays starting six months after reform becomes law. That's a major benefit for a population with a much higher-than-average uninsurance rate; today nearly 30 percent of adults aged 19 to 29 are uninsured, compared to about 17 percent for the under-65 adult population as a whole.
    * Help for adults with pre-existing conditions. Within 90 days, the federal government will set up a temporary national high-risk insurance pool for people who can't get individual coverage because of pre-existing conditions and have been uninsured for at least six months. The premiums will be subsidized but only to bring the premiums costs down to 125% of the cost of coverage for a healthy person. The maximum annual out-of-pocket costs will still be substantial: $5,950 for individuals and $11,900 for a family. The pool will dissolve once ""full reform"" begins in 2014, at which point insurers will no longer be able to turn anyone down because of pre-existing conditions.
    * Help for children with preexisting conditions. Help comes sooner for kids. Beginning in 2010, insurance plans will no longer be able to deny coverage for children with pre-existing conditions.
    * Expanded Medicare benefits. Starting immediately, people who land in the Part D drug coverage ""doughnut hole"" will get a $250 rebate, as well as a 50% discount on brand-name drugs. The Part D coverage gap will be phased out and closed completely by 2020. In 2011, Medicare will pay 100% of the cost for preventive services such as vaccines and screening tests, and also for an annual checkup, without charging any co-pays or deductibles.
    * An end to rescissions. Within six months of enactment, insurance companies will no longer be able to retroactively cancel individual coverage on people who get sick and start filing expensive claims. Often the companies have cancelled because the policyholder forgot to mention some minor, unrelated piece of health history, such as a teenage bout with acne, on their application. The practice, known as rescission, has provoked enormous consumer outrage and resulted in multi-million-dollar fines to insurers. After reform, the only way an insurer can cancel paid-up coverage is if the policyholder has committed outright fraud.
    * A crackdown on excessive premium hikes. News of double-digit premium increases in many states have drawn attention to the fact that state regulators often don't have much authority over health insurer premiums. The White House proposes to immediately create a new national Health Insurance Rate Authority that would review premiums and, if they turned out to be unreasonable, have the power to lower them or even force health plans to pay back overcharges to consumers.
    * Better value for your premium dollar. Right now, buying insurance on your own is a bit of a crapshoot because it's hard to tell good policies from bad ones. As soon as reform becomes law, health plans will have to start publicly reporting the proportion of your premiums that they spend on health services, as opposed to what they spend on administration, profit, marketing, and executive perks. Within a year after reform, if insurers are spending less than 80 percent of premiums on health care for individual or small group policies, or 85 percent for large-group policies, they'll have to pay customers a rebate. They'll also be prohibited from imposing lifetime benefit limits, and the use of annual benefit limits will be restricted, giving you more confidence in the policy you purchase.
    * Help for small businesses. Starting immediately, small businesses can get a tax credit of up to 35% for their share of their employees' health premiums as long as they contribute at least half of the cost. Businesses with 25 or fewer employees, and average annual wages of less than $50,000, are eligible for the credits.

Fixing Iraqi Health Care Comes at Expense of U.S. Needs, Critics Say 

By Ceci Connolly
Washington Post Staff Writer
Friday, October 17, 2003; Page A25 

President Bush and first lady Laura Bush have a vision for health care
in Iraq in which all mothers-to-be receive prenatal care, childhood
mortality rates plummet and every person has access to virtually free
treatment and medicine through an extensive network of 1,400 renovated
hospitals and clinics. 

It is a vision that will cost U.S. taxpayers almost $2 billion in the
first 18 months -- an amount some lawmakers say is too steep,
especially when a growing number of Americans cannot afford medical
care. 

""I certainly understand the need for health care in Iraq,"" said Sen.
Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), who tried unsuccessfully Tuesday to shift
$5 billion from Iraqi assistance to domestic education, health and
construction projects.

""This administration has a sense of urgency in Iraq that I don't see
here at home. We see hospitals closing and the number of uninsured
going up, and yet we don't see any sense of urgency from this
administration.""

The effort to revitalize Iraq's health care system is a source of
pride for the Bush administration in a postwar reconstruction program
that has often been hampered by violence, international squabbling and
logistical problems. Laura Bush has taken a personal interest,
lobbying for construction of a state-of-the-art children's hospital in
Basra that would one day draw patients and physicians from all over
the Middle East.

The Bush administration and many humanitarian relief groups say the
United States has a moral and legal obligation to rebuild Iraq.

""There is no doubt that the one responsible for this is, according to
the Geneva Conventions, the occupying power, and that is the U.S.-led
coalition,"" Morten Rostrup, international council president of the aid
group Doctors Without Borders, said recently.

Administration officials point to political and security imperatives
that make investment in Iraqi schools, hospitals, roads and housing
critical.

""If we are successful at rebuilding health care in Iraq, we can start
turning this terrible war against the terrorists,"" Health and Human
Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson said in an interview. ""We can do
that better, I think, by using a doctor and medical diplomacy than we
can by other means.""

Winning the war on terrorism, Thompson suggested, requires doing
things that ""show the Muslim world we really do care about women and
children."" Medical intervention ""is one way we can highlight our
compassion.""

But as Congress conducts a fierce debate over the administration's
request for $87 billion to pay for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan,
the proposed medical program for Iraq illustrates the inherent
tensions in spending American dollars in a far-off land. At home, the
deficit is rising, unemployment hovers around 6 percent and many
voters complain to pollsters that Bush is not focused enough on their
economic plight.

""The same values that we hold for Iraq we must pledge for all
Americans,"" Rep. Rahm Emanuel (D-Ill.) said. ""The same goals we
envision for Iraq's future, we must envision for America.""

Emanuel and a contingent of liberal House members, in weekly floor
speeches dubbed ""Iraq Watch,"" have contrasted unmet domestic needs
with the ambitious plans for Iraq. The group cites a long list of what
it calls neglected domestic programs, such as veterans' health care,
schools, police on the street, prescription drugs for seniors and an
aging electric grid. 

""Restoring the Iraqi health system is a key part of the overall
reconstruction effort,"" said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (Mass.), the top
Democrat on the Senate's health committee. ""But it is ironic that the
same administration that wants to improve health care in Iraq is so
indifferent to the exploding costs and declining coverage that are
undermining health care here at home.""

William Winkenwerder, assistant secretary for health at the Pentagon,
said better health care in Iraq will enhance stability in the entire
region -- and improving health appears to be one goal around which a
diverse collection of nations and nonprofit groups can unite.

""The health care piece is working, and it's working pretty darn well,""
said Winkenwerder, who added that he believes the medical successes
have not gotten the attention they deserve. ""This is one area where
the coalition has worked closely and effectively, and with a broad
international group.""

In the past 12 years, Iraq's health care system deteriorated from
being the jewel of the Middle East to Third World-quality care. In
2002, Iraq spent $16 million on health care for 25 million people,
Winkenwerder said, or about 65 cents per person. 

Infant mortality rates more than doubled, from 50 deaths per 1,000
born in 1990 to 107 per 1,000 in 2000. More than half the pregnant
women in the country are anemic, and about one-third deliver
low-birth-weight babies.

Emergency intervention and repairs have restored much of the system to
pre-war levels, Winkenwerder and Thompson said. Now they hope to make
Iraq's health system a regional leader once again.

Of the $87 billion the administration is requesting, $850 million
would be spent on health care in Iraq -- about $300 million for buying
generators and medical equipment, and the remainder for major
infrastructure work, according to the Office of Management and Budget.

Bechtel Corp. is the lead contractor on construction projects at
hospitals and clinics; other organizations such as Abt Associates and
UNICEF have received smaller contracts.

That $850 million would be in addition to $211 million spent on health
care from July through the end of this year and $946 million targeted
for health in the U.S.-installed occupation authority's budget for
2004, said James Haveman, the senior U.S. adviser to the Iraqi
Ministry of Health. 

Another $100 million for administration and salaries at the hospitals
and clinics has been drawn from seized assets of Saddam Hussein.

Some international aid experts have voiced skepticism about the
selection of Haveman, whose international experience is limited to
work with International Aid, a Christian relief organization. Ron
Waldman of Columbia University said the administration is focused too
heavily on bricks and mortar, rather than on fundamental public health
approaches such as teaching mothers to breast-feed, immunizing
children and extolling the virtues of hand-washing.

He and many others were sharply critical of the administration request
for $150 million to start work on a new, high-tech hospital in Basra,
a project about which sources said Laura Bush is particularly
enthusiastic.

""A facility designed to handle top-level pediatric care, plastic
surgery, burn treatment -- those aren't things that contribute to
infant or childhood mortality,"" he said. ""That's like building the
penthouse before the foundation.""

U.S. leaders are under ""tremendous pressure from the doctors and
public"" in Iraq to ""make symbolic improvements,"" said Richard
Garfield, a professor of clinical international nursing at Columbia
University, who spent the summer in Iraq advising the U.S. government
and international relief agencies. ""Hospitals are a black hole; you
can pour all the money you have into them and still not get the bang
for your buck.""

Thompson defended the project, saying, ""It's something to leave as a
legacy"" and could eventually draw patients from all over the Middle
East. House appropriators recently eliminated the Basra hospital and
shifted an extra $100 million to repairs of existing hospitals.

In a telephone interview from Baghdad, Haveman said 95 percent of the
$1.1 billion he controls is spent on direct medical services such as
nutrition counseling, vaccines, newborn screening, pharmaceuticals,
equipment, insect spraying, disease surveillance and training doctors
and nurses who have not heard about new Western techniques in more
than a decade.

Haveman nearly gushes over the level of U.S. support in Iraq. Yet he
realizes the United States cannot maintain those levels indefinitely.

Haveman and the Iraqis have done a needs assessment for health care.
Next week, at a donors conference in Madrid, he will ask the rest of
the world for $1.6 billion in aid through 2006.",0,1269671149,,0,False,0,c0mzsn2,t3_bit41,t1_c0mzsn2,t1_c0mzouj,,1426255779,24,False,politics,t5_2cneq,24

""During the winter of 1943, the Lake County (Indiana) Medical Committee decided to take action against the Wagner-Murray-Dingell Bill, proposed legislation that would provide government health care for most U.S. citizens. Also opposed to the bill was the conservative National Physicians Committee. The committee began a membership drive in February 1944. By May 1944, the AAPS claimed members from all 48 states. In 1944, Time reported that the group's aim was the 'defeat of any Government group medicine.' In 1966, the New York Times described AAPS as an 'ultra-right-wing... political-economic rather than a medical group,' and noted that some of its leaders were members of the John Birch Society.

Positions:

""Though it describes itself as 'non-partisan', AAPS is generally recognized as politically conservative. According to Mother Jones, 'despite the lab coats and the official-sounding name, the docs of the AAPS are hardly part of mainstream medical society. Think Glenn Beck with an MD.'

""The organization opposes mandatory vaccination, universal health care and government intervention in healthcare. The AAPS has characterized the effects of the Social Security Act of 1965, which established Medicare and Medicaid, as 'evil' and 'immoral', and encouraged member physicians to boycott Medicare and Medicaid. AAPS argues that individuals should purchase medical care directly from doctors, and that there is no right to medical care. **The organization requires its members to sign a 'declaration of independence' pledging that they will not work with Medicare, Medicaid, or even private insurance companies.**[emphasis added]

""AAPS also opposes mandated evidence-based medicine and practice guidelines, criticizing them as a usurpation of physician autonomy and a fascist merger of state and corporate power where the biggest stakeholder is the pharmaceutical industry. Other procedures that AAPS opposes include abortion and over-the-counter access to emergency contraception. AAPS also opposes electronic medical records as well as any 'direct or de facto supervision or control over the practice of medicine by federal officers or employees.'

""On Oct 25 2008 the AAPS website published an editorial implying that Barack Obama was using Neuro-linguistic Programming, 'a covert form of hypnosis', in his presidential campaign.""

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_failure

To be a quick study consider the following: insurance companies committing rescission, young healthy people not needing insurance while old sick people do, the fact that you benefit when your peers vaccinated against polio, and how do we deal with uninsured people in emergency situations, other than letting their bodies pile up outside the hospitals.

Now there are lots of interesting market oriented ways to solve these various failures but none of them are clear and easy.  We don't have the ability to spin a lightweight market oriented healthcare system overnight.  We simply don't have the collective economic IQ amongst the voting public or the lawmakers.  But we can move toward it bit by bit.  The state level insurance exchange moves in this direction as does the state innovation clause.  While things like the mandate and the ban on rejections for pre-existing conditions plugs some of the biggest holes in the current system.

As libertarians I think its important to choose your battles.  It might be fun to dream up a world with free market medicine, 100% private property, no centralized national defense and no environmental law.  But we should be focusing on low hanging fruit where we have a clear indisputable wins and less messy externalities, such as federalizing more power to the states, privatizing social security, ending the war on drugs, or removing trade and immigration barriers.

That would be a government that does only traditional functions: running a justice system, national defense, and international relations. Since Somalia has none of those, it isn't libertarian, it is just anarchy. As far as I know, there are no governments that have achieved pure libertarianism.

&gt; Ideologically, what's the difference between tax-supported army/police and other tax-supported services? Is the former just viewed as a necessary evil?

Well, think of it as ownership: society is better off when the government run by the people controls all forms of violence. If there were private actors capable of acting with force (private militias) then they could easily subvert the judicial system. Therefore, it is necessary that only the government exerts forceful control over society. However, having government run healthcare or something could be done by the private sector fairly.

Edit to answer your 3rd question: I don't think that would fall under the category of defense. Defense is ""defense from other people"", not from the forces of nature. By that definition, you could institute health and safety regulations (like the FDA) for the purposes of defense, or you could mandate vaccinations for the purposes of defense, etc. etc. Pure libertarians would argue that the changing environment is just a shift in supply and demand.

If Perot wouldn't have dropped out and then re-entered the race after citing bizarre stories of blackmail, he might very well have won some states, if not the election.

People get sick from vaccinations, too, but only the clueless think that we shouldn't vaccinate.  

Industrial production (subsidies and all) results in plentiful, cheap food.  It's not all of the highest quality, but neither does it cause ""great harm to the people of the country.""  The alternative, of course, is higher priced food and that's much less desirable.  But don't take my word for it, [listen to an actual farmer](http://american.com/archive/2009/july/the-omnivore2019s-delusion-against-the-agri-intellectuals). 

&gt;Eliminations of corn subsidies would be a good thing for the Mexican people and would allow them to work within their own system

Work with me here, because we're going to talk about consequences again.  You're right, Mexican farmers can't compete with subsidized American farmers.  They can't compete because their input cost is greater than the cost that they can charge to sell their yield.  If American farmers are not subsidized, then Mexican farmers would be able to charge more to cover the costs of their inputs and they could compete with American farmers. The result of this is--and here's where it apparently gets tricky, so pay attention--the cost of corn would be higher.  Sure, they would be ""working within their own system,"" but I imagine that would be cold comfort to the people who couldn't afford tortillas.  I guess you could make a ""rising tide"" argument that in the long run they might be better off.  However, there's no guarantee of that and, as Keynes said, ""In the long run we are all dead.""

You say it was three years too late, but the funding started the year AIDS was discovered.  Also, this quote sums up the situation quite nicely:

&gt;""You could have poured half the national budget into AIDS in 1983, and it would have gone down a rat hole,"" says Michael Fumento, author of BioEvolution: How Biotechnology Is Changing Our World. ""There were no anti-virals back then. The first anti-viral was AZT which came along in 1987, and that was for AIDS."" As an example of how blindly scientists and policymakers flew as the virus took wing, Fumento recalls that ""in 1984, Health and Human Services Secretary Margaret Heckler predicted that there would be an AIDS vaccine by 1986. There is no AIDS vaccine to date.""

They appear to have done what they could have at the time.

This also seems like an odd quote from a guy who thought that gays deserved to die from AIDS:

&gt;""Whatever else it is,"" Reagan wrote, ""homosexuality is not a contagious disease like the measles. Prevailing scientific opinion is that an individual's sexuality is determined at a very early age and that a child's teachers do not really influence this."" He also argued: ""Since the measure does not restrict itself to the classroom, every aspect of a teacher's personal life could presumably come under suspicion. What constitutes 'advocacy' of homosexuality? Would public opposition to Proposition 6 by a teacher â should it pass â be considered advocacy?""

The fact of the matter is that Reagan was not the conservative hero that the Right remembers him as, and he wasn't the villain that the Left try to paint him as.

EDIT

Also, the article you referenced is inaccurate.  It says Reagan didn't mention AIDS until 1987.  This is a widely propagated myth.  The earliest time I could find Reagan publicly mentioning AIDS is 1985 in the transcript I posted, and again in 1986 in his [Message to the Congress on America's Agenda for the Future](http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1986/20686c.htm).

Your requirement basically describes just about every country on the planet. How about something a little less vauge I refer to (Wikipedia)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism#Core_tenets]

**Nationalism**
Not from a Left Administration

** Foreign policy**

* ""Fascists opposed pacifism and believed that a nation must have a warrior mentality""
* Not from a Left Administration

** Authoritarianism **
* ""A key authoritarian element of fascism is its endorsement of a prime national leader, who is often known simply as the ""Leader"" or a similar title.""
* Obama Poll numbers would suggest otherwise.

**Social Darwinism**
* Health Care reform for all is far from Social Darwinism

** Indoctrination**
* Hitler's words: ""When I take a look at the intellectual classes we have - unfortunately, I suppose, they are necessary; otherwise one could one day, I don't know, exterminate them or something - but unfortunately they're necessary.""
* So much for that Disdain for Intellectuals not being a requirement of fascism. Although the LEFT does have science it doesn't agree with. This HAS NOT been seen by the Obama Administration. 

**Abortion, eugenics and euthanasia**
* ""The Fascist government in Italy banned literature on birth control and increased penalties on abortion in 1926, declaring them both crimes against the state""
* Not seen by a the Obama Administration

**Culture, gender and sexuality**
* ""Fascism promoted principles of masculine heroism, militarism, and discipline; and rejected cultural pluralism and multiculturalism.""
* Not seen by Leftist Administration

So lets see you commented things that I ALREADY agreed in, and the rest are just things YOU don't see as *requirements* of fascism. 

&gt; Not even remotely a requirement of fascism. In fact -- when that ""power"" is expressed through corporate, nationalized unions, it is a HALLMARK of fascism. See: Mussolini's Italy.

*Fascist governments exercised control over private property but did not nationalize it.[180] They pursued economic policies to strengthen state power and spread ideology, such as consolidating trade unions to be **state** or **party-controlled** *.  When Obama creates a federally controlled union call me. 

&gt; Furthermore, you MIGHT want to review IP and Patent law here. Or the Watts ""racist!"" decrees. The left has the science it disagrees with just as much as the right does. And ""Fill-in-the-blank"" help you if you disagree whilst they're in power.

Yet is the only one so far I've heard whose even brought up IP and Patent Law reform. Hell people on the left do stupid shit but last time I checked Obama didn't stop funding the Avian Flu vacine because he thought it could give kids autism now did he. He also increased funding instead of decreasing it, so your being disingenuous when you try to pin blame of the left for being as scientifically retarded as.

&gt; There is a reason why ""fascism"" and ""Corporatism"" are interchangeable terms, man!

Hummm because **Italian Fascism involved corporatism, a political system in which the economy is collectively managed by employers, workers and state officials by formal mechanisms at national level**.

He needn't do so under the standard of corporate-government mutualism that is fascism.  However, you might want to look up regulatory agencies and how they interact with unions.

&gt; Nationalism ** Not from a Left Administration

And yet the last time there was a compulsory service program for the nation's youth, the nation in question was Germany and it was called the ""Hitler Youth"".  Which is where the colorful colloquialism of ""Obama Youth"" came from.  You *might* want to educate yourself a little more about the people you're so rabidly supporting.

&gt; Foreign policy  Fascists opposed pacifism and believed that a nation must have a warrior mentality  Not from a Left Administration

Obama is expanding the military budget.  He has actively expanded the presence in Afghanistan.  He has furthermore -- just like all the Democratic presidents of the last half-century-plus -- actively endorsed the role of America as an active ""peacekeeping force"".  A rose, sir, by any other name.  Interventionism has been a hallmark of the American Left since Wilson.

&gt; Authoritarianism A key authoritarian element of fascism is its endorsement of a prime national leader, who is often known simply as the ""Leader"" or a similar title. Obama Poll numbers would suggest otherwise.

Again, not even remotely a requirement for fascism.  Just totalitarianism.  Which aren't equivalent, though for historical reasons they are frequently conflated.

True,cometparty,,,"&gt; So are normal companies. Explain to me how a corporation is any different then an LLC or even a partnership.

Exactly. They're bad, too. Corporations are different because of the impersonalized nature of the situation.

&gt; So if you have a great idea, say a potential cure for cancer but you just don't have any money to actually do the research other people should be bared form giving you money to help your research...

Eh, what? Money doesn't even really exist. Just like ""ownership"", it is a purely legal invention. You don't need money. If you have a potential cure for cancer, well then we can get you the resources you need. Why does it have to be all about profit. When the man who invented the polio vaccine was asked why he didn't patent it he answered ""This is everybody's. Would you patent the Sun?""

&gt; If I gave a company all of my savings i promise you I have an allegiance.

Only insofar as the ""company"" has a fiduciary duty in regards to you. You don't care about the workers or the patrons. All you care about is getting your money. That's exactly the point I was making. Your relation to the ""company"" is more about not caring than it is about caring.

&gt; I would agree to the extent that a corporations sole legal purpose is profit. I take great issue with this and think this should be looked at and revised.

OK, then. Lots of people do. Then you're not that different from me. We have to move towards [stakeholder theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_theory). 

&gt; Uh ya they lose all their money how could you be more liable then that?

How would you be more liable? How about criminal responsibility? 

&gt; This is actually exactly opposite of a feudal society.

It's feudal in that the people benefit just because they have privilege and they don't do anything. Their money works for them. They're just a bohemian class of individuals; unproductive parasites. Sorry if that's harsh. Can't think of any other way to describe it.

&gt; For example explain to me how this is any different in a privately held company or partnership? If you work for someone you are fucked compared to the guy who has ownership, so how is it so different if you have lots of little owners?

A sole proprietorship can actually respond to worker demands because they actually run things. They call the shots. They hear complaints. Yes, they can be just as ruthless as shareholders, but they tend not to be, in practice. Usually, it's their only business, so they treat it as though it's precious. Shareholders don't care. They buy and sell shares at the drop of a hat and have nothing to deal with beyond that. They're much different, actually.

&gt; This has nothing to do with a corporation but business in general. So really you aren't hating on corporations but capitalism as an economic system. I would love to hear your alternative, seriously. I admit it has lots of flaws but I have yet to see a better system, I am willing to be convinced though.

Well, my immediate concern is getting stakeholder rights for stakeholders of businesses. If you labor for a company for 20 years, you shouldn't be able to just be fired without coming away with something other than your wages. You put a lot into that company. You have a stake in it. So, I think economic democracy is important to establish. It's not necessarily socialism. It's still about profits and what-not. But it's moving more toward turning corporations into mutuals. 

Mutuals used to exist in a much larger capacity (think Mutual of Omaha, Liberty Mutual, etc.), but they started becoming de-mutualized in the past 25 years or so much to many peoples' chagrin. A mutual is something that's owned by its members and more or less run for their benefit. They're like shareholders except they're not about profit. It's kind of like statism on a really small scale. Without these, society really wouldn't have been able to function back in the day. Credit unions are basically mutuals. The recent health care bill actually sets up a system of mutual health insurance co-ops. So, this is what we need to do with corporations. We need to democratize them. In Europe, many times workers have the right to elect people to sit on the Boards of Directors. That's part of the reason exploitation of workers is so much lower there.

I'm not saying investment shouldn't exist, just that ""ownership"" shouldn't be eternal. It should expire after someone has made a fair return on their investment, like patents do.

It is eliminating the individual. It's *forcing* people a part of a system(that has failed in most instances), and *forcing* them surrender control of the outcome of their life to the state, against all instinct we have. It's asking someone to care more for people they've never met than their own family and friends.

Part of communism, socialism, or anything else you'd like requires people to surrender their choices, their beliefs, and their desired way of life for the collective. That is *absolutely* the destruction of the individual.

&gt;In socialism, the government is the producer but in the communism, there is no government and the people are the producers. USSR and NK and Vietnam were not communist.

Last I checked you were a socialist, not a communist. And yes, in communism [they control the means of production](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism)

""*In modern usage, communism is often used to refer to the policies of the various communist states, which were authoritarian governments that had centrally planned economies and ownership of all the means of production. Most communist governments based their ideology on Marxism-Leninism.*""

&gt;They were left-wing dictators at the best. China is not communist, it allows capitalism so again its just a dictatorship under the guise of communism to gain popularity with the workers.

No, they allow capitalism under the guise of communist because they'd be a 3rd world nation otherwise. China would control as much as they reasonably could to ensure a successful state. They have just opted *not* to control too much industry, because that happens to be the way to secure a successful state.

The ""Chinese Way"" (they've published reports on this, but I can't find them atm) is using communism to lift an impoverished country into literacy and off the farms, then use capitalism to compete globally and increase quality of life. The entire point of communism and the earlier tight controls is to establish a population like *we already have* that's *capable* of succeeding in a version of capitalism. I obviously disagree with this, but the point is that even firm believers in control and communism see the flaws in your argument.

&gt;In communism, the workers create the items and their motivation to create better things is that if they don't society as a whole including them will suffer.

While this would be lovely if it was a part of human nature, it's not. It goes against our instinct, against the traits that have evolved into us, and it's been shown time and time again that people are simply *not* motivated enough by such things.

As a result and in order to instill that belief, excessive Government control becomes necessary. They have to quash large elements of the human condition for it to work, and the only way to do that is brutality. As I've stated before, this is the goal of North Korea. Their goal is *exactly* the mindset you advocate.

Here's some of the side effects of that mindset(ignoring the brutality required to get there). These are from the video I linked to above.

Historically, life was nasty, painful, brutish and short, where friends, families and loved-ones could be cut down at a moment's notice by wildlife, accident or disease, and that's why *the entire drive of human technological evolution* has been to get as far away from this situation as possible.  Here's a question, kids: if living in a tee-pee as an iron-age nomad is so fucking great, *why did we bother inventing houses?*

It's only because we're so incredibly comfortable living in our air-conditioned houses, driving further each day without even thinking about it than our ancestors would have moved in a lifetime, chatting on-line with people on the other side of the world and routinely living until we're fucking 90 that some people have the time and space to reflect and romanticise the past to such a ludicrous fucking degree.

What you are witnessing right now is the market firmly rejecting homeopathy and other nonsensical treatments.

Pseudoscience cannot overcome real medicine in a free market.

True,[deleted],,,"&gt;I'm not sure, but I think we might be talking at cross purposes here. The reason I raised the issue of propaganda was that a degree of anxiety can be produced in a population and exploited for gain, whilst those raising anxiety remain aware that the perceived threat does not exist, or is far less significant than presented. In this case anxiety is raised, but those who initiated it need not necessarily be in a state of anxiety.

This is a possibility, especially when the disseminators of propaganda have ulterior motives, such as grabbing someone's oil.  Maybe H1N1 frenzy was spread by someone trying to sell vaccines.  Things like that.  But is that always the case?  And even with an ulterior motive you have anxiety: for example with oil, there is fear of dropped economic output, fear of losing the lifestyle one is accustomed to; with the desire to sell more vaccines, there is potential fear of losing one's lifestyle by not making enough money this quarter, or anxiety regarding not belonging to the strata of society that you'd like to belong to (someone trying to claw their way into the circle of billionaires or whatnot).

I think people would be somewhat inoculated against media fear-mongering if they would reflect on their own insecurities with an eye to diminish them.

In our society, we value freedom.  We believe an individual should be able to own a media company.  Combine these two beliefs, and you get the fact that we're constantly exposed to potential media manipulation, not as a flaw, but as a *feature* of our way of life.  It's part of the freedom we have.  If we want to *maintain* our freedom, we have to become more mature.  So the owners of the media companies will have to be more mature and do less fear-mongering.  And maybe we can maintain steady pressure on the media companies to reduce their fear mongering tactics.  At the same time, all of us in the audience can and should become slightly more mature and less susceptible to fear.

Free societies are build on the back of a decent degree of personal responsibility and largely voluntary, tolerating mutuality (opposite of ""every man for himself"").  I think if we, as a culture, cannot maintain and embody those qualities, we'll end up in a dictatorship sooner or later.

Again, they are so surrounded because of the decades of terrorism. And for some reason even though Israel responds the way it does the Palestinian continue their war crimes.

Things like vest bombs? Blowing up school buses? Airplane hijacking? Other than reversing cause and effect what horrible acts against civilians does your mind come up with?

&gt;I don't accept the fact that the Palestinians are ""polio"" that need a vaccine. 

Try again. You assert that since the cure works there is no need for it. That since Israel reduces the number of dead Israelis Israels should not do what it does.

&gt;Your analogy makes assumptions that people on my side of the argument would never accept. Nice try though.

True,ElectricRebel,,,"&gt;You will have to take me at my word that I am not anti-science. But if I had been present at the launching of the Titantic, I would have marveled at the accomplishment and laughed at the unsinkable arrogance of its designers.

Laughing at them is not nice...

More seriously, all big engineering projects have risk. But if we never take risks, we never make progress. We learn lessons from our failures and even if people die, more people are helped in the long run. And sometimes arrogance is a good thing. It gets people excited. It gets the financial wheels turning. The people that actually work on the projects, not the marketing folks of the world, know that failures do happen in practice. 

Take Apollo for example. It carried an extremely high risk of killing the astronauts. The Apollo 1 crew died on the ground in a test. The Apollo 13 crew almost died. But, because they were willing to take risks, they went to the moon.

Therefore, sometimes taking a risk, even if it means people can die, is worthwhile. The proponents of the precautionary principle are, in my opinion, way too stringent and result in the red tape that has created the modern NRC, which has not approved a new reactor in years. We need to overcome this if we want to make progress.

&gt;I can think of no greater example of that than the personal automobile.

This is exactly what I'm talking about. Sure the car is dangerous. It is probably the most dangerous thing we do in our everyday lives. But it is worth the risk. It makes us mobile. It brings food and supplies to us to help make survival trivial when our ancestors had to fight for survival every day.

This is why you need to think of technology in terms of opportunity cost. Technologies almost always carry risk. For example, if an HIV  vaccine was developed that killed one out of every thousand people that used it, it would still be worth taking because HIV itself has a much higher fatality rate.

&gt;WTF were we thinking?

That the direction we were going is better than the direction we came from. Sure, the industrial revolution, the rise of oil, and the rise of cities brought problems, but they solved many more problems than we had before. Just take a look at a rural place in Africa, with its food shortages, disease, and violence, and compare it to New York City, Paris, or London and tell me which place you prefer to live. You may be weird and pick rural Africa, but the vast majority of humans alive today would pick the city.

&gt;moreso for the handling of waste than the engineering functions. 

How is nuclear waste even a problem? It has never killed anyone. It is just sitting around waiting for the political winds to shift to allow for it to be consumed in a breeder reactor or a nuclear transmutation system. After it runs through these systems, it will be back to the background level of radiation. The idea that nuclear waste will be around for 100,000 years or whatever anti-nuclear people quote is a complete non-issue because we already have the technology to get rid of it and just need to make people aware of it.

&gt;But I believe full swing into a golden era of unsinkable nuclear plants

No one is claiming they are unsinkable. I'd expect to have an occasional meltdown if 100% of our power was generated using light water reactors (although I'm also an advocate of molten salt reactors, which cannot meltdown because they are already in liquid state by default, which once again, physics can help reduce human error). Although, with careful engineering, we can ensure that the meltdowns are more like Three Mile Island and not like Chernobyl (which, as I've said elsewhere, was so bad mainly because it didn't have a containment building, which is really a no-brainer). Overall, nuclear power has an incredibly good track record in the US and western Europe. No one has died compared to many thousands from fossil fuels. The idea that we aren't smart enough to manage risk is just wrong.

&gt;would detour us from conservation (more efficient consumption of electricity) 

The idea that efficiency will solve our problem is based on bad assumptions. If you aren't aware of it, you should look up Jevon's Paradox and read it. If you look at the past 50 years, we are vastly more efficient with our usage of electricity. But the total consumption keeps going up. I can think of no area where this is more true than computers. Modern computers are millions of times more power efficient than early computers, but our total energy consumption from computers is vastly higher.

&gt;greener alternatives and life styles (urban planning, architecture, mass transportation, suburban agriculture) that might make both fossil and unsinkable nuclear unnecessary.

Without absolutely massive reductions in total energy consumption, there is no way that non-fossil or non-nuclear sources can meet our needs. Read ""Sustainable Energy: Without the Hot Air"" for an extremely detailed overview of this. People will not do this. In fact, the opposite is happening. Even if the US dropped its energy consumption by 1000%, China and India would just take its place and then some. Fighting the long term economic trend of industrialization is not practical in any way. And billions are still living in absolute poverty. Why should we deny them the same comforts of a modern lifestyle? Decreasing our energy consumption will harm them the most.

Overall, it seems you have a fundamental philosophical problem with the industrial revolution and its after-effects. You may prefer a ""back to the Earth"" and ""simple living"" approach, but that is simply not going to happen. People like consumption and material goods and there is nothing wrong with that. If you look at history and the modern third world, pre-industrial times are an extremely miserable place to live. In the present state of affairs of a large world population that is gradually improving its average standard of living, we basically have a choice: continue using fossil fuels or switch to nuclear. As you have said, you reluctantly choose nuclear and as I've said I enthusiastically choose nuclear. In time, I believe the choice will be made for the world as fossil fuels deplete, but that may be after we do massive amounts of damage to the environment due to CO2 emissions, so I would prefer to switch ASAP.

And I'll conclude with this: although you may mock ""unsinkable"" science and engineering, take note of how we are communicating this message: over the Internet, which is one of the greatest achievement and most complicated scientific achievements of all time. And most of the time it works very well. So, don't mock things as unsinkable. Think in terms of probabilities. As technology improves, things because less sinkable, but never perfect. But we do not live in a perfect world (hell, we could die at any moment from a gamma ray burst or an undetected asteroid), so the risks of technological development are acceptable in the vast majority of cases.",0,1276929733,,0,True,0,c0sfozm,t3_cg8q8,t1_c0sfozm,t1_c0sfjr8,,1426348484,1,False,politics,t5_2cneq,1

Cite cite cite. Actually, I find this relatively easy to believe. Yet again, to convince me of anything new, youâd have to show (1) that itâs genetic in nature, and (2) that that justifies Your Mysterious Position. Iâm also still curious what you think blackness is.

&gt; There are very few large free-standing structures in sub-Saharan Africa that were not built by whites. This fact is just one of a multitude of symptoms of a far more wide-ranging problem.

The first sentence is true-ish. Itâs also true-ish, for example, that there are very few continuous living traditions of oral literature in Western Europe. Doesnât really prove a lot. I also agree with your second sentence. That problem is called by many names, including imperialism.

When you say sub-Saharan Africa, are we finally seeing some hint of what you mean by race? If the ancient Egyptians built the pyramids, is that evidence that they were white? Or what?

&gt; The numbers are nothing short of absurd and if I quoted them you would simply say I was lying, and that would be understandable.

Reeeaaally. Those are some *awful powerful facts* you got there. So why do you believe them? Why would you expect anyone, especially anyone whoâs actually been around black people, to believe them? Why would you be afraid of my thinking youâre wrong any more than I already do?

If I told you I had a similar secret argument on my side, I hope you would laugh ruefully. Which is what Iâm doing at you. But you could still cite cite cite and, if I canât rebut, make me look quite the fool to all my liberal groupthink buddies.

As far as youâve actually expressed, youâre just someone who thinks that black IQs are lower than white IQs but canât explain why. Itâs ever so boring. I want you to try to prove stuff and connect it all into a coherent worldview. But it seems you only want to talk about how great it will be once we see it.

Youâre spending a lot of time telling me I donât listen and not a lot of time describing and defending what you believe. Do *you* know what you believe? Is there any philosophy at the core of your motivation? Do you love what you belong to, or do you just love the belonging?

 The contaminated product, which Baxter calls ""experimental virus material,"" was made at the Orth-Donau research facility. Baxter makes its flu vaccine -- including a human H5N1 vaccine for which a licence is expected shortly -- at a facility in the Czech Republic.

People familiar with biosecurity rules are dismayed by evidence that human H3N2 and avian H5N1 viruses somehow co-mingled in the Orth-Donau facility. That is a dangerous practice that should not be allowed to happen, a number of experts insisted.

Accidental release of a mixture of live H5N1 and H3N2 viruses could have resulted in dire consequences.

While H5N1 doesn't easily infect people, H3N2 viruses do. If someone exposed to a mixture of the two had been simultaneously infected with both strains, he or she could have served as an incubator for a hybrid virus able to transmit easily to and among people.

Now, examine this. You pretended I offered no other negative than the spread of misinformation, when you read twice an entire paragraph containing a non exhaustive list of negatives. 

This just happened. Are you still denying that you've created a delusion for yourself? 

Because if you don't, the only other choices are stupid or liar. 

Either you honestly misrepresented reality as a defense mechanism, or you actually fail to comprehend reality, making you stupid, or you do comprehend reality and purposely misrepresent it to dishonestly try to win an internet argument, making you a liar.

On top of that, the existence of a good aspect doesn't negate the existence of bad aspects so your argument is completely irrelevant again.

Again, that's like saying a murderer is good because he's also productive.
&gt; 

1. a greater range of cultural exposure ; White supremacy, extremism.

2. significantly easier access to academic sources, such as peer reviewed journals, scientific publications, and books in general ; and a lot more misinformation, http://www.creationism.org/, http://www.naturalnews.com/027178_vaccines_autism_NaturalPedia.html


3. greater ease at conducting international business : and international fraud.

4. Convenience; ability to monitor/control your home remotely, etc. ; and to steal your identity to rob you.

5. Instructional how-tos; fix your car, recipes, projects, etc.; most  of which are crap. Here's how to make a pipe bomb for terrorism purposes: http://www.linkbase.org/make-pipe-bomb/

6. greater ease and finding/forming relationships, and keeping in touch with loved ones;  and trapping teenagers to rape and kill them. It's also been used to bully depressed teenagers into killing themselves.

You also tried to argue this was about net neutrality. Then you tried to misrpresent my argument as it being about the spread of information, instead of the internet.

And it's dominated by the usual large interest groups: corporations and governments. A large portion of the news here comes from television networks. It's also used extensively to rob people.

No, actually, you never said such a thing. Your response to this was that I was a troll. You're lying again.

And it's not a rebuttal to the argument, it's a rebuttal to the analogy. This is the argument:

""The entire point of judgement is comparing the positive to the negative.""

You're still pretending that the negative aspects don't count. And a human can be interpreted as a tool. Change human to employee, and conceptually, you have a tool. The analogy respects your logic perfectly. Replace it with a gun, a rock, a blade, a telephone, any random object and it still works.

Btw, you completely invalidate this argument yourself:

""it's dominated by independent users. Sure it might have corporate owned websites, but who's responsible for filling it with content? Such as forums, youtube, instructables, aggregators, etc.""

The internet doesn't do shit. You're using what persons do with a tool to argue the tool is a positive. And then pretend the analogy to what people do outside the internet doesn't work. The internet is just another environment. And it has been used to kill people, by other people:

No, I don't. I said it was a tool that can be used for good or bad. 

All the arguments you make are about specific actions with a tool being good or bag. You actually never made an argument about the actual tool. 

That's like saying a rock is a positive because it's used to construct buildings. Constructing buildings is a positive. The rock is a fucking rock. 

It's an object. It can't be good or bad, positive or negative. Only what you do with it can be.

""It remains an information platform and it remains completely neutral since it's a tool that can be used both constructively and destructively.""

The fact that you personally perceive it as a mostly good influence on the world has absolutely no effect on the fact that it could be use ONLY for a bad influence on the world. Just like a fucking rock. 

And just for shits and giggles, how about you substantiate your statement. Demonstrate truth wins over falsehood on the internet. Then give a negative value to bullying people into suicide and traping children to rape and kill them, attribute a value to the good of the internet and compare. Quantify positive vs negative on the internet.

Try. It'll be fun.

All of the points you raised are covered in the first page or so of the linked article.

This is *normal* in Iran, people move to cooler parts of the country in summer and you can vote anywhere in the country. Overall turnout was consistent with a census a few years before, having grown *exactly* as was expected due to the population growth rate. 

As I said, *every single* suggestion of fraud is covered in depth in the linked article. Statistical analysis has shown no fraud took place. Polls did not say anything that you suggest. Mousavi won his home region (Shabestar). Everything you know about it from the regular media is a lie, just as they did in 2002 WRT to Iraq.

No, my contention is that most people are extremely suggestible and unable to look things up for themselves. Feel free to continue to believe it was fraudulent, just be aware that you are very wrong.

Billions upon billions are completely unaccounted for. Vastly more money has been ""legitimately"" siphoned off in the war industry. For four years the Iraq oil wasn't even being metered, the oil industry just helped itself. The money made of this war is not even comprehendable.

Key is in showing the indifferent people how low, dirty and vile these guys are in their unscrupulous propaganda. 

Sure, Beck is specifically targeting a fringe demographic stupid enough to buy his crap. But if he keeps saturating this space with these ideas and concepts, some of them will inevitably seep out of his demographic and into the general public. 

We are generally lazy and often tend to adopt ideas and concepts not at their face value, but within a frame of a social proof: if other people believe in it, then it must be true. 

You would be right to say that clever people wouldn't buy into that crap, and you would be 100% right. Clever people wouldn't, but average people?

True,Blackrabite,,,"&gt;Two points here. First off, I don't understand why you don't think there will be competition in a free market? Do you believe that government controls pricing in the current state system?

&gt;Second, why do companies carry insurance today if they can simply charge more? The reason is, that charging more takes time to accumulate resources. If the owners sole factory burns down, how is he supposed to charge more for a product he can no longer manufacturer?

Yes, the government has a large hand in controlling the price in a free market system. They put restrictions on labor, on materials and on monopolies. In countries that do not have these restrictions you see slave/child labor and poisonous lead paint. These items that are shipped over seas to the US are not bought because of federal laws. In countries without those laws these items and these factories proliferate because they sell a product cheaper than competitors. If the free market system regulated itself, how is this possible?

&gt;I agree that companies might try this, but why would consumers buy crappy products? Without government protecting bad companies, then quality products and companies will flourish in a free market.

Companies won't ""might"" try this, they do try this and they succeed until government steps in and corrects the issue.

&gt;Your argument might have been valid 50 years ago, but today information is readily available to anyone that wants it. Anarchy and voluntarism might therefore had been a poor choice previously, but it's a concept that it's time has arrived.

So you think that information precludes ignorance and stupidity? Do you believe that vaccines cause autism despite scientific evidence to the contrary? All the evidence is available yet there is a huge movement of people motivated by fear and ignorance that thinks vaccines are the leading cause for autism. They live in a world where information is virtually free yet they come to idiotic conclusions. Yes, people are stupid and gullible. I believe this and if you can say with a straight face that every person you've met in your lifetime is capable of deciding what is best for them and deciding correctly then you are an outright liar.

&gt;Wow, I can't believe you said this. So you think you're smarter than everyone else or are you dumb like the rest of us?

Yes, on average I am smarter than most people. You are also smarter than most people on average, the fact that both of us can have a civil discussion on political views means we are likely smarter than the average person. Were you under the delusion that most people were as smart as you? Go work at a fast food restaurant in the inner city for a few months, that should change your mind.

&gt;Nothing in a voluntarily society precludes people hiring experts to assist with these decisions. Your attitude is that all knowledge and job professions will cease to exist under an anarchy, but they won't. All the experts we have today will still be around and lets be honest, the experts in private industry are a lot more knowledgeable than the civil servents in government. Just look at how clueless Obamas government response was to the Gulf oil spill, they constantly had to rely on the experts at BP for answers.

That's your answer? Each individual that doesn't know enough to make a decision can hire an expert? People not knowing enough to decide something and them knowing that they don't know enough are completely different things.

&gt;The government enforcement against BP hasn't been some shining star you make it out to be. Still this question goes back to my point about insurance. If BP couldn't pass the externalities to the taxpayers (as they are doing), it would fall upon insurance companies to foot the bill. Insurance companies would therefore keep a closer eye on BPs operations than they do today.

Have I made it a shining star? I'm saying that because our government exists something is being done to help with a disaster. Under your anarchy nothing would be done because there is no motivation on anyone's part to do something about it.

&gt;Two points here. First, from a logic standpoint it doesn't matter if voluntarism works or not, you have to admit that if it did work, it would be superior to an involuntary system. You can still argue that it doesn't work, but that is the step after admitting that in an ideal case, it is better.

That is completely backwards and illogical in every sense. It's a better system even though it can't work? The fact that it cannot work means it's not a viable system at all, and it's not.

&gt;I agree, the ""laws"" would change frequently, but the good thing is that humans aren't stupid and when a ""law"" is discovered in a nearby region that makes sense and people like, it will quickly be adopted. In a state society, there can be years of delay while a new law is passed to change the status quo (e.g. gay marriage).

So what happens with laws that violate human rights? Let's say part of New York settled mainly by christian fundamentalists that follow a modern Mosaic Law. Inside that settlement they stone gay people and disobedient children to death.

&gt; corporations can not be trusted (nor should they have to be)

In the absence of regulation, trust plays heavily in the profitability of a company.  Let's look at your examples:

&gt; pollution

Pollution is a huge problem.  It's also an example of the tragedy of the commons, wherein people who do not own property have no motivation to protect it.  At the turn of the century, farmers tried to sue industry for polluting their crops.  Industry was protected by the government under the guise of *the greater good*.  We reap the unintended consequences of that government intervention heavily today.

By protecting industry from lawsuits and preventing the private ownership of the commons, government has subsidized technologies that pollute.  In the absence of such interventionist protection, industries looking to avoid lawsuits by private property owners would have had to invest in technology that prevented pollution.  How many decades of development in clean technology have we lost because of government intervention in the market and the justice system?  To add insult to injury, those who are interested in protecting the environment today tend to be the same ones promoting even greater government intervention.

&gt; public health

In the US, government has been interfering in the health care industry for decades.  The result?  Higher prices, less coverage.  Why in the world would I want more of that?  You might say that it simply hasn't been the right kind of intervention, but I have two answers for that: One, intervention is violence and the threat thereof.  It has no place in a peaceful society.  Two, even if it were morally acceptable for government to use force to control some sector of the market, it cannot possibly control something as complicated as health care in such a way that it has some beneficial impact.

&gt; consumer safety

Have you ever witnessed a restaurant take a hit or go under after people became sick after eating there?  Or, why do people prefer VW's to porsches when looking for a safe vehicle?  Consumer safety.

&gt; I want a group of thugs that steals money from people at gunpoint to fund research. I want a group of thugs that steals money from people at gunpoint to fund large scale public health projects (things like vaccination campaigns only really work on a large scale). I want a group of thugs that steals money from employed people at gunpoint to give unemployment benefits to those out of a job so that they can stay on their feet while finding another. 

FTFY.

Look.  Society has problems, problems that we both want to see solved.  We all have different ideas about how a healthy society should look, and that's fine.  What is *not fine* is pointing guns at people and trying to force our preferred view of society on them at the point of a gun.  Mostly because it's immoral, but also because it doesn't accomplish what we want.  There are solutions out there, but they are not going to be as easy as pointing a gun at someone and telling them to do one thing and not another.  They are going to be hard, they are going to be complex, and they are going to be *peaceful*.

True,aletoledo,,,"&gt; Yes, the government has a large hand in controlling the price in a free market system. 

One more reason an anarchy would be better, since it's not just physical, but finacial turmoil the government produces. Perhaps the current unemployment woes the nation is seeing is because of these price controls. Price controls were a major cause of the first great depression as well.

&gt; In countries without those laws these items and these factories proliferate because they sell a product cheaper than competitors. If the free market system regulated itself, how is this possible?

Under a system where people have to take more responsibility for their purchases (i.e. nanny state), this might not happen. As I mentioned before, there will still be experts releasing information to the public, it's just a matter for the public to assume the responsibility for being an educated consumer. I'm not even sure the ""lead paint"" scare was even a threat. Do you have any evidence to suggest that it wasn't merely big government stirring up trouble?

&gt; Companies won't ""might"" try this, they do try this and they succeed until government steps in and corrects the issue.

Example?

&gt; Do you believe that vaccines cause autism despite scientific evidence to the contrary? All the evidence is available yet there is a huge movement of people motivated by fear and ignorance that thinks vaccines are the leading cause for autism. They live in a world where information is virtually free yet they come to idiotic conclusions. 

Interesting choice of topic. Are you 100% certain that no vaccine is harmful? I don't mean the specific claims about one vaccine and autism, but about all vaccines. I think you have a bit of blind faith in the fact that government has proven all these safe, because as you said, drug companies will put the cheapest material into these vaccines and some (swine flu) have not had enough time to be tested by the government. 

Your claims that industry is evil (tainted product) and that it also brings goodness (vaccines) are at odds with one another. It would seem that these protesters are simply in agreement with you, well half of your opinion.

&gt; That's your answer? Each individual that doesn't know enough to make a decision can hire an expert? People not knowing enough to decide something and them knowing that they don't know enough are completely different things.

Your answer is better? Where a government official forces us into a single choice, because they don't take into account that we're intelligent enough to make our own decisions? The government decision can be suboptimal, since it's likely a decision to cover the widest possible audience.

&gt; Under your anarchy nothing would be done because there is no motivation on anyone's part to do something about it.

Under anarchy, the motivation is profit.

True,Blackrabite,,,"&gt;One more reason an anarchy would be better, since it's not just physical, but finacial turmoil the government produces. Perhaps the current unemployment woes the nation is seeing is because of these price controls. Price controls were a major cause of the first great depression as well.

Price control had nothing to do with the first great depression. The Great Depression was caused mainly by an economic downturn coupled with the federal governments failure to respond in time with adjusted interest rates. This was made worse by the fact that the economy was still based on the gold standard making it impossible to boost the economy without creating severe inflation. The major turning point that brought us out of the depression was leaving the gold standard behind and using foreign exchange markets as the new value.

Your anarchist economy would be worse in every way, not only is there no federal reserve or control over interest rates the entire economy is driven by the strictest Gold Standard, gold and other precious metals. To make it worse the economy would be rigidly controlled by whatever persons controlled the mining and minting of those metals.

&gt;Under a system where people have to take more responsibility for their purchases (i.e. nanny state), this might not happen. As I mentioned before, there will still be experts releasing information to the public, it's just a matter for the public to assume the responsibility for being an educated consumer. I'm not even sure the ""lead paint"" scare was even a threat. Do you have any evidence to suggest that it wasn't merely big government stirring up trouble?

I like Lead paint as an example, let's do this thing. Once again, I'm quoting from Wikipedia, which you should enjoy since it's a collaboration of independent people and the dirty government can't get it's hands in there to control our thoughts and actions.

""Lead is also added to paint to speed drying, increase durability, retain a fresh appearance, and resist moisture that causes corrosion.""

There, that sounds awesome. We all buy some lead paint because it's awesome, but wait...

""In some countries lead continues to be added to paint intended for domestic use [1]  whereas in others regulation exists that prohibits this, though lead paint may still be found in older properties painted prior to the introduction of such regulation e.g. in the U.S. and the U.K. and Australia.""

So that's weird, my government says that Lead paint is bad. I'll trust them and get rid of mine. You however hate the government, it's only out to cause you trouble, do violence to you and generally ruin your life, so you keep the paint. I want to remove the paint but the government says, ""Effective April 22, 2010, the US EPA now requires that all renovators who work in homes built pre 1978 and disturb more than six square-feet of lead paint be RRP certified. The new regulation will affect over 100,000 renovators across the country. Renovators can find out more about the program and training locations at [4].""

That sucks, I have to pay extra for people specially certified to remove lead paint, It's probably just the government trying to cost me more money because it's a dick and it hates the people it governs, oh well, I'll do it anyway because I don't want to be violated by evil policemen.

You however, and 5,000 other people like you think the government is out to get us, but you did hear from an independant source that lead paint is bad so you remove it yourself and replace it with regular paint. You heard about the new EPA requirments but you're pretty sure that the government (since it only does evil) is just trying to screw you out of money, it's probably fine if you keep paint ships off of the ground.

""One myth related to lead-based paint is that the most common cause of poisoning was eating leaded paint chips. In fact, the most common pathway of childhood lead exposure is through ingestion of lead dust through normal hand-to-mouth contact during which children swallow lead dust dislodged from deteriorated paint or leaded dust generated during remodeling or painting. Lead dust from remodeling or deteriorated paint lands on the floor near where children play and can be ingested.""

Looks like your kids have [brain damage.](http://www.reuters.com/article/healthNews/idUSTRE57O64G20090825) 

&gt;Example?

Lead Paint. As linked above, in countries where the government has no regulated it Lead Paint is widely manufactured and sold because even in the information age people would rather save some money and endanger lives that make educated decisions.

&gt;Interesting choice of topic. Are you 100% certain that no vaccine is harmful? I don't mean the specific claims about one vaccine and autism, but about all vaccines. I think you have a bit of blind faith in the fact that government has proven all these safe, because as you said, drug companies will put the cheapest material into these vaccines and some (swine flu) have not had enough time to be tested by the government.

&gt;Your claims that industry is evil (tainted product) and that it also brings goodness (vaccines) are at odds with one another. It would seem that these protesters are simply in agreement with you, well half of your opinion.

No, of course I'm not 100% sure that all vaccines are safe, how is that related? Just because I understand that government is an overall force for good also does not mean that I have blind faith in them, that wasn't even part of the argument. The argument was that people, when given the option to educate themselves and make good choices are still incapable of it. Small Pox was eradicated through the use of vaccines because governments around the world went so far as to declare martial law, using extreme violence to force the vaccine on people.

&gt;Your answer is better? Where a government official forces us into a single choice, because they don't take into account that we're intelligent enough to make our own decisions? The government decision can be suboptimal, since it's likely a decision to cover the widest possible audience.

Because people on the whole are not intelligent enough. You may be smart enough and I may be, but in general people are stupid, lazy and selfish. I know that I'm upset that my kid might have to go to school with another kid who's mom decided vaccines were dangerous. The fact that she made a stupid decision now has the potential to harm her child, my child and hundreds of others.

&gt;Without a government, there would be no ability for such atrocities. This is what anarchy is meant to eliminate. Your statist position has to explain why such a government is better than no government. We don't even need to make it hypothetical, we can say it's Iran.

Without the government there would be no ability for such atrocities. I had to repeat that one in case you didn't read it after you slapped it down there. How would anarchy eliminate cultural and religious violence? The entire government of Iran is based on the religion of Islam. That government is almost exactly what you describe when you talk about your anarchy. It is a group of people banding together with the same cultural and societal beliefs. They have chosen to rule with those beliefs in place and they lead to violent death on a regular basis. Tell me in what way the government of Iran as it is today would be different under Anarchy?

True,MyMourningPenis,,,"The reason they make us fight is to create Order Out of Chaos (Problem-Reaction-Solution).  They create the problem, the people react to it, and they give us the preconceived solution.  The solution usually results in more government control and the people having to give up their freedoms and liberties for security (false security). 

For example, the Globalists control the banks, so fund all sides of the war that gets many countries fighting with each other (problem), get the people of the world to fear and realize the horror of the war (reaction), and then propose the League of Nations.  If that doesn't work, repeat the process again, and propose the United Nations.   

The Globalists are a bunch of sociopaths who want to control every aspect of the world, and their plan is to create a one world government (New World Order) and reduce the global population by 85-90 percent.  The remaining population will work for the elites.  The population is being reduce through stealth methods such as putting chemicals in the drinking water, vaccinations, GMO Food, and other additives in what we eat.  

The key point is that slow and gradual change is necessary to accomplish their goal b/c the people will slowly accept the change.  If the change was sudden and immediate then the people will notice and rebel against it.  The additives that we take will not immediately cause use to get sick, it will take decades before the disease or cancer emerges.  It might emerge quicker in children b/c their bodies are more sensitive.      

Only about 1000 or so key people run the world, and everyone else are puppets.  These puppets are compartmentalized and don't realize how their contribution is helping the overall goal/agenda.  For example, only a few people knew what the Manhatten project was during development, the rest of the people were not aware of it.  It's like how the military is structured (vertically), orders come from the top and are carried down, and the further down the order goes the less those in the structure are truley aware of what the agenda of the order is.

True,jstevewhite,,,"&gt;I take this to mean that you think the owner gets to set the price of the goods they produce (""his services""=owners services).

No, that's not what I said. I said:

""The business owner offers a service - creating the collective that allows all of those people to produce the product - just as the employees do. "" 

The philosophical justification for the ""mutually beneficial relationship of employers and employees"" is that the employee offers a discount on his labor in return for the agglutination of paperwork and sales. It even works this way sometimes, but it creates an imbalance in power. 

I'm well aware that prices are an intersubjective min/max of the interaction with the customer and the salespeople. OTOH, the business owner has much more control than the employee. 

&gt;Do you really think the owner dictates wages? If so, why are they paying the temp workers $9 and not $8? Why not $1? Why even pay them at all?

Sometimes, yes. There are many industries where people are paid minimum wage because the laws require it. I'm well aware of the relationship between supply and demand; I'm not arguing that those relationships don't exist, any more than I would argue that the flu doesn't exist. I *am* arguing that it's not necessarily the best humanitarian decision to allow such things to dictate our treatment of our fellow human beings, any more than we'd say ""Don't bother with those vaccines; that's just the way the world *is*.""

&gt;Of course the owner pays the workers a wage that allows them to sell their product at a profit. If you have a problem with that, fine. However, I am unsure of an alternative that is theoretically or practically superior.

The discussion at hand is occurring in an environment where the wealth gap between the ""owners"" and the ""workers"" has grown to epic proportions and shows no sign of stopping. 

I'm not anti-capitalism, but I am anti ""free market will fix everything"", anti ""greed is good"", anti ""the bottom line is king"". People deserve reward for effort, but that reward does not include a free pass for the abuse of those who help them succeed. 

I'm not saying we ditch the system wholesale - I'm no communist, either - but I think we should do things like moving tax incentives to make it beneficial to a company's tax bottom line to hire domestic employees and pay them decent wages, and make it less beneficial from a tax perspective to move those jobs overseas. I think we should rescind the laws that destroyed the union's power - collective bargaining is necessary for any equity.

Owners have no control over price, employees have no control over price.  If Motts sold applesauce for $50 a jar, nobody would buy it.  If you don't believe that, fine.

You are saying that the flu doesn't exist.  You are saying that the owners have control to pick wages...they don't. If you acknowledge that wages are a result of supply/demand and you think that is a poor way of determining wages, that is fine too.  But how do you propose we determine wages?

True,Facehammer,,,"&gt;This, however, supports what I'm saying. Our immune system has to be prepared to deal with every iteration of every pathogen!

Except the reality of the immune system doesn't support what you're saying. Sure, the immune system *can* produce antibodies to most antigens - but *only* after (I think) B-cells undergo a process akin to natural selection in order to identify the right antibodies and grow them up in useful quantities. Incidentally, when this has already happened once, the B-cells don't all go away, which means that the system is capable of producing a much more rapid and effective response to an antigen on the second exposure to it. This is how vaccines work. 

What I'm saying, and have been all along if you bothered to fucking read my posts, is that the immune system is reactionary, rather than being prepared for exposure to every possible antigen in advance. 

&gt;Furthermore, a pathogen that effectively kills its host reduces its rate of transmission, meaning it is less successful as an organism!

It is hard to turn back now. Like I said, we are lucky to not have been in that environment, and are largely immune from religion and fallacious thought. It could still happen, but most of us have been vaccinated by being exposed to a few idiot zombies in small doses, over the years.

I would mostly feel bad for Ginger, as a zombie, for being raised and infected by other zombies. It sucks for her. The zombie analogy stops at trying to kill zombies to protect yourself. Just thought I should be clear about that. I understand running away, out of fear and frustration by the stupidity. Obviously some of those that were infected can rebound, it is just very hard, limited by genetics, and it rarely happens. Bless the people who have the patience to help the zombies.

True,maleman,,,"&gt;I am one of these people. Guess what? I'm against the war too, and have been all along.

I know, but the original argument was absurd. The power for government to invest in health care is  no different from the power they have to do many other things, including wage war, build roads, educate people, provide law enforcement, etc. It's a pointless endeavor to single out health care.

&gt;I advocate reducing the size of our military to just 20,000 or 30,000 officers, there to train any more if we needed it to become larger in a hurry. I advocate making it illegal (treason, punishable by death) if they step foot outside our borders without a formal declaration of war by Congress, and that even with that declaration that they're only allowed within the borders of whichever nation we've declared war against (or within 100 miles of our coastline for the navy in peacetime, 100 miles within the coastlines of our enemies in wartime).

...*slowly backing out of room and starting to close door as softly as possible*...

None of those solutions would solve the perceived challenges you think they would address.


&gt;But see... even though I support all these things, it's easier to just paint a caricature and then rally your team to hate it, isn't it? This is why we can never find common ground, you and I. Because even after I've improved these things, that's not enough and you still want me to be a socialist.

&gt;Fuck you. Die in a fire.

I'll admit my OP was snarky, but this type of nonsense is the reason I can't take Gadsen Flag wavers seriously. By your broad definitions of Socialism, practically everything the government does qualifies. Systems built over our history to address very fundamental and widescale challenges in America such as education, infrastructure, defense, and yes, even health-care are treated as if they are some sort of plot to rob you of some tiny sliver of ""freedom"" that you can't even really consistently define, let alone quantify. Schools, highways, law enforcement, and a healthy population are all things that sustain the entire environment you exist in and benefit you in ways that you either ignore or dent. I mean, how useful is a more literate population to *you*? Or how does it benefit *you* if vaccinations for other people are paid for from a percentage of my tax dollars?

The answer is that even if you accept these things benefit you and are neccesary, you think the free hand will always provide, even though it's clear it doesn't in all cases, or when it does - it does so in a slow and haphazard manner that could have better approached from the top-down instead of the bottom-up. And certainly that's been my observation for large scale systems that require things like a consistent unified interstate highway, or educational system, etc. They just can't be privatized and expected to perform as well on a consistent basis due to their fundamental nature.

At that point, to me, it's obvious that it's still cheaper for America to provide these essentials than to let anyone go without. Because in the end, I gotta live here and deal with the people and places that define the boundaries within which I can work and live. It's nothing to me to pay a little extra to ensure that the people around me have a better chance of landing a skilled job, this raising more stable families, paying higher tax revenues, etc. 

To me it's a matter of both practicality, and ultimately of financial responsibility. The ability to get educated, have basic health needs provided for, being secure from criminals, etc., are all *fundamental needs* that if not provided for, rot the very core of society - and in this and other respects they represent the most important investments we can make both for our present and future.

Intellectuals of any kind can see this.  They are dealing with an extremely complex system which we know they cannot predict.  It's that simple.

Yes, some is... the problem comes in when they start interpreting the data.  They usually take a sample from a very specific population, don't control for millions of variables, and then make proclamations about human beings in general, which is wholly illegitimate.

&gt;It's true that psychological data are messier than for some fields, but this doesn't make psychologists any less intellectual.

It would not be impossible for a psychologist to be non-intellectual, I didn't mean to say that.  I only meant to say that, as far as I know, they all are.  If there are psychologists whose conclusions are limited to the nano-scale that their research is actually limited to, then yes, they would be intellectual, otherwise only pseudo-intellectual.  A system can be entirely logical and self-consistent and still be irremediably WRONG.  Correspondence with material reality determines that.  I have never read a psychology study (and I have read many, mostly on NIHs PubMed) whose conclusions contained anything like ""For humans of primarily European descent whose experiences since birth include high levels of exposure to flat moving images representing fictional characters in both animated and ""real"" form who have had adequate nutrition composed of mostly the items listed in Appendix A who have been exposed to a median level of vibration as level X and whose interpersonal relationships have been of type B and whose telomere length is average C and ...........""  It would take reams and reams and reams of paper to describe the immensely complicated system that they are claiming to make conclusions about.  And I have never, not once, seen any psychology study which restrained its conclusions precisely to apply solely to the conditions which they addressed.  This cannot simply be ignored.  Yes, the human brain is wonderful at picking out patterns.  To the degree of uselessness in any intellectual terms.  Psychologists have to be aware of the profound flaws in the human mind when attempting to tease out patterns in the complexities of systems involving trillions of dependent and independent variables.  Entire branches of psychology could, quite imaginably, be based on nothing more than some confirmation bias.

&gt;I suspect you're underestimating the complexity (another word for ""messiness"") of the data that ""vaccine researchers"" work with.

I may be explaining it in such a way that it sounds like I am, but that is only because my memory is crap and I can't remember all of the stuff about reverse transcriptase and methylation and such.  Yes, the systems they deal with are complex.  That is why they reduce them in complexity.  Why they take a culture from a person and isolate a single virus, nothing more than a useless scrap of genetic code without a cell to facilitate it, and study that directly.  They don't stand 20 feet from an infected person and ask them about the last time they felt angry and hope to draw some conclusions that will help them formulate a vaccine.  They deal with exact biochemistry, they control for variables, and when they don't know, they say they don't know.  They state their findings limited to their studies.

&gt;What you've read of of neurotransmitters and receptors is also hand-wavy concept-mixing, if it came across as hard fact instead of some bright fellow's best guess. Explanations like that from people who don't do neuroscience are almost always facile oversimplifications.

Of course they are.  Luckily, with neuroscience though, the research and the papers aren't exactly the same.  They actually have nailed down the involved factors, eliminated the other variables, and tested their ideas as directly as they can.  And then when they make their statements of conclusion, they limit their application to the conditions they studied.  Any guesswork about how that might impact more general things is clearly delineated as such.  With psychology, there is nothing but.

Can you point me to an example of good hard psychology?  I would honestly be interested in seeing an example.  I think from reading my explanations, you should know quite well what I would pick out as flaws.  Especially watch those conclusions.  

&gt;Knowledge of ""material reality"" is not a requirement for an intellectual.

What is the point of the term ""intellectual"" if it can be applied to someone who knows a great deal of combinations of words, but none of them mean anything?  And how could any of them mean anything if they do not apply to material reality?

&gt;You're discounting any field of knowledge that doesn't provide neat, mechanistic answers to straightforward questions; that is exactly  what I consider the antithesis of a true intellectual.

Not... exactly.  If the answers are not neat, not mechanistic, and the person stating them says ""Do not apply this idea to any situation other than that described, as there is no reason to believe it would hold"" then they have covered themselves.

I disagree that some clear line can be drawn between the acts of the Bush administration and those of the Obama/Roosevelt/Truman/Lincoln administrations (or any other president who ever did anything with respect to another country).  It is the responsibility of our Commander-in-Chief to first and foremost keep us safe, and it is certain that in doing so, he (or she, if that ever happens) will make decisions that place what the Commander believes is good for the country over the rights of certain individuals or groups of individuals.

What I understand Jon Stewart to be saying is this: ""Spending your time hammering Bush on war crimes is wasted time if you want to move this country forward.

So in case you didn't understand, libertarians and conservatives were AGAINST this measure as a matter of civil liberties, as they didn't want to have their daughters take what they think is a needless, albeit safe, vaccine.  The only ones who were in favor was the pharma company Merck who produced it.  

Maybe you read some nonsense propaganda article and were confused about who you were supposed to be mad at.

Libertarians are typically more anti-war than either republicans and democrats, and have been so for a long time.  As evidence, look to the only real libertarian in congress Ron Paul, who voted against the war and funding it.  So including Cheyney and Rove who are neo conservative Republicans is bullshit.  Similarly, blackwater is the result of a co-op effort between Government and business, strictly against libertarian views.

True,ReturningTarzan,,,"Yes, Lomborg is one of the people making the argument. And The Guardian is one of the contributors to the hysteria that don't listen to the argument.

&gt;Climate scientists have set 350ppm and a 2C average temperature rise (from 1750 to 2100) as the upper range targets to prevent a global climate disaster. Since we are already at 390ppm and since a 2C plus rise is a near certainty, how does Lomborg's appeal to forgo sharp reductions in CO2 emissions reflect climate science? He argues that there are ""smarter solutions to climate change"" than a focus on reducing CO2. This is hardly smart: it's insanity.

It's a non-sequitor: Global warming will present serious problems for us in the future =&gt; we should stop at nothing to reduce CO2 emissions. Lomborg's mistake is trying to keep a level head in a discussion about the environment, an area where level-headedness is traditionally unwelcome.

In his eagerness to discredit Mr. Lomborg, Mr. Friel doesn't stop to actually consider Lomborg's argument and whether the obvious solution (cutting CO2 emissions) is worth the price. Yes, people will die as a consequence of this ""global climate disaster"", but people are dying now! So if an initiative to cut carbon emissions by 20% over the next ten years costs $100 bn, that's $100 bn which won't feed the starving masses of the third world, or buy mosquito nets and malaria vaccines, or build schools and hospitals, or contribute to peace initiatives.

You need to realise that the ""global climate disaster"" is not simply by-definition the biggest possible disaster we could have, and that we are in the midst of some pretty serious contenders for that title already: 25000 people starving to death every day (mostly kids), thousands dying from malaria, HIV spreading rampantly, a billion human beings without access to clean drinking water, religious fundamentalists with WMDs (Israel, USA), corrupt governments with WMDs (Russia etc.), an economy driven by perpetual exponential growth that can't possibly be maintained forever, financial bubbles in every corner of the market just waiting to pop, overpopulation, dwindling fossil fuel reserves, etc. etc. etc.

So we need to be pragmatic. How big a problem is this ""global climate disaster"" in terms of, say, its death toll? Is it bigger than malaria? Bigger than HIV? Bigger than tobacco? The Guardian is mostly a respectable newspaper, but in the article you linked to, try to find some kind of assessment of the scope of the problem. Mr. Friel tries to imply a doomsday scenario, but is that actually supported by the current science? Quantify the disaster; Lomborg tried to do so - any other bids?

&gt;Nuclear warfare wouldn't mean the end of the world.

&gt;Does that mean we should do nothing to stop it?

And this is precisely what happens. You suggest that a problem is not **necessarily** the biggest one we have, that **maybe** we should all calm the fuck down and take a deep breath and put it into perspective, then assign it a reasonable **priority** and look for the most **efficient** solutions for the short term, mid term and long term. And the hysterical masses take that to mean you consider it a non-problem.

I did not say there was a logical path from realising a catastrophe isn't the end of the world to the dismissal of any effort to combat it. I said that an objective, level-headed assessment of the size of a catastrophe is a prerequisite for relating to it in a sensible way.

True,jbrown84,,,"Both the editorial and the reddit title are somewhat misleading characterizations of SCOTUS' fall docket. The continued criticism of last term's *Citizen's United* in the NYT op-ed is understandable, but they seem to be misrepresenting the import of upcoming cases in order to support their claim about a trend with the Roberts court. 

*FCC v AT&amp;T* (the corporate personal privacy case) most directly deals with corporate rights. Strangely, the NYT doesn't mention it. Since the appellate court ruled in AT&amp;T's favor, the fact that SCOTUS took the case indicates either that they want to weigh in or reverse the lower court (otherwise they could've just let it stand). Incidentally, SCOTUS reverses the 3rd circuit a majority (near 70% IIRC) of the time. I guess this particular datapoint didn't fit their trend. 

They also don't mention *Costco v Omega*, a hugely important copyright/consumer rights case dealing with the first sale doctrine. 

The NYT says two areas are ""worth watching"": preemption and whistleblowers. 

Of the 4 preemption cases this term, the NYT focuses on one: *AT&amp;T Mobility v. Concepcion* [Is AT&amp;T evil or what?]. It's fair to say this is a business-centric case. However, there are 3 other preemption cases which demonstrate that preemption is very much relevant to other policy areas. Policy-wise, preemption tends to be a mixed bag and how people view it in individual cases often depends on their politics. For example, progressives may favor preemption in immigration law. Conservatives may favor preemption limiting liability for firearms sales. The Voting Rights Act is another major example of preemption. Examples of issues which may be particularly dear to redditor's hearts include federal/state marijuana policy and [a ban on taxing internet access](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Tax_Nondiscrimination_Act). 

The other preemption cases are: *Chamber of Commerce v Whitting* (a challenge to an Arizona anti-immigration law where the ACLU and Obama administration have weighed in), *Bruesewitz v. Wyeth* (addressing the scope of vaccine manufacturers' liability - with obvious public health and ""vaccines cause autism"" implications), and *Williamson v. Mazda Motor* (do federal auto safety laws preempt liability? Plaintiffs allege that making cars with 2-point ""lap"" seat belts instead of 3-point ""shoulder"" seat belts in the backseat is negligent). 

For *Thompson v. North American Stainless*, the ""firing a whistleblower's spouse"" case, see what I said about FCC v. AT&amp;T: SCOTUS could've just let it stand, and the statistics slightly favor a pro-whistleblower ruling. 

Rehash: One, arguably two, purely business-centric cases (*AT&amp;T Mobility* and *Williamson*) out of 5 where the others deal with significant policy issues of immigration/employee rights/and vaccine lawsuits is poor evidence of a pro-corporate agenda.

Like I did yesterday, because my throat was hurting. I walked in, waited 45 minutes (at the A&amp;W next door) and got him to look at my throat. He says it's probably strep, so I went next door and got some penicillin. No cost for the visit, $15 for the pills.

Or like last month when my girlfriend suggested I get some tests done. I actually walked right in to my family doctor, and he gave me a cup to pee in and sent me to the lab at the hospital. There, I waited half an hour, they drew some blood, and I was on my way. No cost, not even for parking. (I'm clean by the way).

Or how about the time when I was sixteen and I stepped on a rusty nail. My dad drove me to the walk-in clinic (don't go to emergency for non-emergencies) and since a rusty nail is about the most urgent thing they deal with there, I was rushed right in. Free tetanus shot.

Or the time when I hurt my hand in Ju-Jitsu class. Some guy just landed on it funny, and it was still hurting a few days later. I went to the family doctor, he said it was probably just some soft tissue damage, and it would work itself out. That wasn't good enough for me though. I wanted an X-Ray. Even though the doctor told me that it wasn't necessary, I got one. For free. He was right, by the way. My hand healed on its own, and the X-Ray was completely unecessary.

Or the other time I hurt my hand doing JJ. I tried to catch someone's kick (I was new) and it really buggered up my thumb. Walk-in took a look, wrapped it up real tight, and sent me on my way. No cost.

Same thing when I hurt my ankle playing soccer. They wrapped it up, and this time the doctor actually spent a good ten minutes showing me how to properly do the exercises that would strengthen the muscles and help them grow. No cost.

Or the countless times as a child when I would get check-ups and vaccines and booster shots for free.

I have about another half-dozen personal examples of exceptional non-emergency care. I've never paid for anything but pills in my life, and I've never waited more than an hour to see a walk-in doctor, or taken more than a day to get an appointment for a check-up or something like that.

Sure the hospitals are trying to screw the insurance companies and the insurance companies try to screw their constituencies, but there isn't a lot of evidence of excessive profit-taking by either industry. As far as I can tell, it's mostly due to the structure of the health market. 

The market seems to be set up, in the US, in a way that de-emphasizes bringing down the price of existing technologies in favor of creating newer, better (and thus more expensive) treatments. So, while the US dominates in the creation of new vaccines and experimental treatments, and we have the most advanced health-care system, we also have to pay (**a lot**) to be at the cutting edge. 

The reason that other countries have so much better returns on money spent is that they're not paying for the innovation. The US consumer is literally subsidizing improvements in healthcare systems around the world. We are the goose at the head of the V (if that makes any sense).

Ugh, wrong. I like how you just make these wild assertions as if they're valid points. Again, your understand about agency action is really poor. Moreover, agencies don't want to spend *their* financial resources defending poorly made administrative decisions. It is a waste and cumbersome. I give you the facts and your childish position carries on. 

There is a slew of cases dealing with legal review of arbitrary decision-making by the Supreme Court that set out fairly defined principles for what is and isn't valid when it comes to making those decisions. Likewise, the fact-finder in this situation is a non-political person. The head of FEMA, the one appointed by Obama, is the only one with any real political ties for the sake of your shitty argument. All of the people that work day in and day out in the agencies do so with the understanding it is their job long after Obama is gone from office.

The person making the decision isn't Obama. Likewise, W. Craig Fulgate, current Undersecretary of Emergency Preparedness &amp; Response, you know, the guy in charge of FEMA, is a life-long technical expert in the terms of emergency response. He has worked under Republican Governors in Florida and now a Democratic President.

Next, present some actual *facts* that underscore that Obama interjected politics into this. You don't even have any anecdotal evidence other than some sort of bullshit cynical response that assumes all decisions like this are some how tied up into the clips of a Governor making political statements. If there was any reason to ever deny federal assistance, then it would have been in [2009](http://www.kwtx.com/home/headlines/43695537.html) during the swine flu outbreak. However, the CDC still gave Texas the 37,000 requested vaccines.

Why? Because that's how agencies fucking work. They're designed to be as non-political as possible to carry out their **statutory obligations**. If they're not compliant with their statutes, then they're in deep shit on a **constitutional level** with SCOTUS. Funny, I wager the thousands of people that work for any of branch of the administrative state want to keep their jobs and continue to do what they've been tasked with doing.

&gt;Yeah, this is the same government that can't serve the people because they're too busy stalling important legislation to earn cheap political points. Grow a brain brah

Of course not - but I'd say the same thing about anyone who finds Dane Cook funny. Again, it doesn't have anything to do with government. Evolution is a complicated theory and someone who's brought up to be religious has a lot of reasons to doubt it. No, I don't like the fact that someone's religious, but they may have other redeeming qualities. 

&gt;The fact that we are talking about whether she's a witch or not is absolutely ridiculous at this level of the game! Don't you think so?

The fact that we're talking about whether or not she's a witch is the fault of *liberals*, not O'Donnell. Democrats were trying to dig up dirt on her and they found some (if you can call dabbling in witchcraft as a teenager ""dirt"") and I think it's pretty shameful that the Democrats and the media are dredging it up. It's meaningless nonsense. 

&gt;wouldn't you rather that they spent their time talking about them instead of talking about witches and bearded marxists?

&gt;When people are voting for candidates that can talk only in slogans and engage in petty demagoguery, when it is completely obvious there is absolutely nothing of substance there (I swear!) don't you think there should be some sense of outrage? 

Absolutely. If that's the case with a candidate, don't bother voting for them, since they aren't thinking for themselves. However, there is something to be said for voting in a so-called ""useful idiot"" who will vote the way you want because they were told to. It's not honorable and it's a contribution to the dumbing down of politics but I can understand the practicality of it. 

&gt;insulting them is counter productive. I agree 100%. What else do you do then?

I'm not saying O'Donnell has anything to offer - I don't know anything about the woman. If you think O'Donnell is a moron then don't vote for her. What I was talking about was the way you talk to *people*. Compassion and understanding for the human condition is a start. Religious people, those who don't believe in evolution, people who take homeopathic drugs, anti vaccination people, etc, are not stupid people.

I'm a fiscal conservative and a civil libertarian and when someone tells me that I only want low taxes and legalized drugs because I'm an evil rich-loving asshole who wants poor people to die in the streets it doesn't do anything to change my mind - all it does is reinforce my idea that the other side can't back up their ideas with facts and instead have to resort to emotion. We're all guilty of it at times, I'm not saying you're an asshole - everyone gets fed up, but what you need to understand is that the attitude you displayed in the OP is not helpful to anyone, especially not yourself.

True,ElectricRebel,,,"&gt;This is a form of ad hominem argument

Read your comments above. You did hate on industry: ""Technology is exploited by industry, which cares only about profit and market share. It doesn't give a crap about the human condition."" Regardless of if that statement is true or false, it certainly qualifies as ""hating on industry"".

As I said, I think that industry often gets out of line, but we need to work with industry to accomplish things.

&gt;This is a form of a false-choice argument. Everyone was NOT ""poor and extremely cruel by today's standards."" Likewise, with ""How come no social movements occurred to improve conditions back then?"" There have been social movements throughout history.

It is well documented that the vast majority of people had very shitty lives until very recently. Are you in denial of this?

Also, please name some successful social movements before the industrial revolution that wasn't based on one person's imaginary friend being better than another. Other than maybe a few brief periods during classical Greece (and certainly not in Sparta), I doubt you will find very much.

&gt;That originally was your basic premiss--take all the money from social services and put it into research. You characterized technology as ""the foundation of economic growth ... and social progress"" and ""a precondition"" for social progress.

Now you are mischaracterizing what I said. Social movements and social security are very different things.

&gt;What happens to the millions of people who rely on societal support while the researchers are working on solving technological problems? 

The question is hypothetical and is about opportunity costs. I posit that in the long term, increased R&amp;D funding does more good than spending it on social security. Yes, people will suffer in the short term, but people will be much better off in the long term.

&gt;More ad hominem.

No it is not. I stated an opinion that I think it is a shame that liberals don't focus more on R&amp;D. That is clearly an opinion, not an attempt to discredit an argument by attacking the person. You need to learn your fallacies better.

&gt;False characterization. I said that ""old issues may lessen only to be replaced by new problems"" in response to your statement ""Once we reach a certain degree of advancement, the issues you mentioned (energy, health care, environment) are moot."" The point was that there will always be new problems to solve.

Not a false characterization at all. You are just grasping at straw to be against my idea so you starting listing a bunch of things that aren't relevant at all. Besides, those problems could be also solved by R&amp;D.

You seem to be getting very angry simply because I believe that R&amp;D is more important than the welfare state. All of our modern comforts (i.e. the things the welfare state pays for) come from past technological advancements. For example, what use would universal healthcare be without penicillin and vaccines?

Evidence that fluoride may cause earlier puberty in animals:

There were not enough subjects to make any firm conclusions so an interpretation of the data is conjectural. However, the results do suggest that the HF (High-Fluoride) females had an accelerated onset of puberty as judged by several indices of pubertal development in rodents. At 7 weeks, the HF females were significantly heavier than the LF females (p &lt; 0.004); as heavy as the HF males and LF males. The ventral gland in the HF female developed significantly earlier than in the LF female (p &lt; 0.004). Vaginal opening occurred earlier in the HF female than in the LF female (p &lt;0.03).""

Evidence that fluoride may cause earlier puberty in humans:
&gt; ""The first step in assessing a health risk by a substance to humans is the identification of its harmful effects on animals. A health risk to humans is assessed using results from human epidemiological studies in conjunction with results from animal studies. The Newburgh-Kingston Study (Schlesinger et al, 1956) showed an earlier age of first menarche in girls living in the fluoridated Newburgh than in unfluoridated Kingston. The current animal study indicates that fluoride is associated with an earlier onset of puberty in female gerbils. Furthermore, more research was recommended on the effects of fluoride on animal and human reproduction (USPHS, 1991). This project has contributed new knowledge in this area.""

So obviously the initial research is fairly damning and there needs to be some actual investigation of this.

I initially started researching fluoridation because of my interest in my own dental health, and I found out that fluoride is _fairly_ effective at treating dental carries, but only because people don't perform basic steps to clean their teeth. By far the most effective way to prevent carries is to eat less sugar, and it shouldn't be that hard because the bacteria responsible for carries can only feed on simples sugars, not carbohydrates and not artificial sweeteners. Furthermore, there is already a [carries vaccine](http://www.wired.com/medtech/health/news/2004/05/63510) for animals which is supposed to be in human trials. As far as fluoridation goes, there are much safer ways to get it in your teeth than putting it in the water supply. For example, putting it in toothpaste.

From a human rights standpoint water fluoridation is kind of fucked up too, it'd be like forcing vaccinations on everyone (except that vaccinations are safer). I know some people here would probably be for that, but from a freedom perspective it should not be legal.

True,Xenogyst,,,"**TL;DR:** Spun narrative, lack of good data analysis, loose speculation about corruption != good journalism.

The CDC has to think in terms of prevention when assessing novel influenza risk, so while I'm not an expert in epidemiology, it seems reasonable that they would have to add some corrective guesswork to reported figures and that those figures would ultimately err on the side of caution.  After all, how are you supposed gather a large body of evidence towards an infection you are trying to prevent?  It's too late if tons of people are sick before you take action.  In fact, if this was an article discussing the mathematical and/or social errors of the CDCs methods, I definitely would be OK with that.  However, the article assumes the methods were faulty because they weren't perfect in their projections for nefarious reasons.

Look at this section:
&gt;There was no uniform system for collecting data on suspected swine flu victims in the US, which led to confusion in the absence of accurate statistics. The CDC acknowledged that the figures being collected on âconfirmed and probable casesâ in the US contained no separation between âconfirmedâ and âprobable.â In fact, only a small percentage of the reported cases were âconfirmedâ by laboratory tests. This faulty data and much more like it from around the globe was given to the WHO...

It just spews out details with a slanted analysis.  After all, if you are trying to make a model that errs on caution (remember, you can only prevent, there is no treatment), what's wrong with using some corrective modeling?  Maybe if they provided some sort of evidence or testimony as to why it was inappropriate or unusual I would buy the narrative, but they don't even try.  The article is definitely trying to spin something probably necessary for such statistical modeling as ""faulty.""

Speaking of which, even if I am completely wrong about everything so far and that the CDC really was at fault out of pure incompetence or corruption (not that this article convinces me at all obviously), I would still be fine with an article that pointed out why it happened.  Instead, this article connects, without a shred of evidence, the faults of the CDC with novel H1N1 with corruption by pharmaceutical industries.

The article basically said:
Why did the CDC use this 'predictive math' you ask?  Corruption, of course!  They cooked the books out of the influence of greed.  How do we know?  Because the pharmaceutical companies made money off of the products!  Even though our health system is a for-profit industry, people making during times of health panic = corruption.  

Don't believe me?  See it compared to the section, and I mean basically the only section, where they connect the CDC and the pharmaceutical companies:

&gt;The CDCâs data was then used to justify massive vaccinations, which created huge profits for the pharmaceutical industry. The CDC posits that the data sent to them by the states is âunderestimated.â The CDC then inflates figures of âunconfirmedâ cases, many of which are cases of seasonal influenza.

That kind of thinking is basically where the article went, and to me that seems like a conspiracy ramble.  Obviously, there are real corruptions in the government and real problems I'm sure with the CDC, but to just suggest corruption out of pure speculation is linking without evidence, i.e. not journalism.",0,1287993450,,0,True,0,c13c6f2,t3_dtu50,t1_c13c6f2,t1_c135ph3,,1426533760,1,False,politics,t5_2cneq,1

True,Kerplonk,,,"*1a1.  Several reasons.  One insurance companies basically already say hey we will really help you out when you need us, not like those other guys.  If everyone says that in a vague sense it doesn't really put anyone on top.  Two  If you get more specific than that you have to worry about libel in case you're unable to get all of the facts.  Three you open yourself up to attacks for the same processes (any industry that has been around for a long time basically works the same way everywhere).  And finally you may be attacking another specific company but the message alot of people are going to get is ""Private Insurance companies screw you when you really need them.""  I'ts kinda like when someone gets salmonela from peanuts.  People don't stop eating one brand of peanuts they stop eating all peanuts.

*1b2. By that logic why do anything.  Why free the slaves if blacks are still going to be discriminated against (Slavery's still alive in well in many parts of the world including some small examples in the us).  Why come up with a vaccine for polio people still have to worry about small pox.  The point is we should contintually attempt to make improvements whenever we can.  In the education case I honestly believe every person who grew up in the US and didn't have some kind of mental handicap or some sort of nightmare home life is able to read.  The point is that if goverment insurance is able to effectively cover more people than private insurance in that particular area its the better option.

*1b2. Do you have to disagree with absolutely everything I say just on principle? Why do you think anything that works in the US is definitly going to work somewhere else with a totally different culture/environment/government/population etc.  Some reasons I think it won't include: countries having corrupt governments, countries having less material wealth, countries having more pressing mattters to attend to, countries having a different national mindset.  The world is a complex place and every input affects the output in one way or another.

*2.  The point was if you can get the same service from the government for a lower price you come out ahead.  There's not some magical economic principle that money spent on taxes is somehow counts more than money spent somewhere else.

*3. I'm not a psycologist but it probably has something to do with sharing the cost.  You know how if you go to a reatsraunt to eat and your going to split the bill people order more expensive food than you might have otherwise because the amount you pay isn't really going to be affected by how much you spend as much as it will be by how much everyone else spends so you might as well enjoy yourself?  I'd imagine whatever principle is responsible for that works the same with taxes.  I don't know if you remember the origin of this argument but it was that a politician has more motivation to give you good service than someone in the insurance industry so the second statement not why do or don't prefer government insurance to private insurance isn't really applicable.",0,1289009954,,0,False,0,c14n3dg,t3_dzbcv,t1_c14n3dg,t1_c14k42l,,1426556144,1,False,politics,t5_2cneq,1
True,krwawobrody,,,"&gt;*1a1. Several reasons. One insurance companies basically already say hey we will really help you out when you need us, not like those other guys. If everyone says that in a vague sense it doesn't really put anyone on top. Two If you get more specific than that you have to worry about libel in case you're unable to get all of the facts. Three you open yourself up to attacks for the same processes (any industry that has been around for a long time basically works the same way everywhere). And finally you may be attacking another specific company but the message alot of people are going to get is ""Private Insurance companies screw you when you really need them."" I'ts kinda like when someone gets salmonela from peanuts. People don't stop eating one brand of peanuts they stop eating all peanuts.

This applies to all other industries as well.

&gt; *1b2. By that logic why do anything. Why free the slaves if blacks are still going to be discriminated against (Slavery's still alive in well in many parts of the world including some small examples in the us). Why come up with a vaccine for polio people still have to worry about small pox. The point is we should contintually attempt to make improvements whenever we can. In the education case I honestly believe every person who grew up in the US and didn't have some kind of mental handicap or some sort of nightmare home life is able to read. The point is that if goverment insurance is able to effectively cover more people than private insurance in that particular area its the better option.

So, you don't want to help everyone but just more people? By spending twice as much on education we would be able to teach more people. Should we do it?

&gt; *1b2. Do you have to disagree with absolutely everything I say just on principle? 

I just find it strange that you are focusing only on US, when there are many countries in much worse situation. You can save much more people there.

&gt; Why do you think anything that works in the US is definitly going to work somewhere else with a totally different culture/environment/government/population etc. 

Because none of your arguments mentioned that.

&gt; Some reasons I think it won't include: countries having corrupt governments, 

US has corrupted government.

&gt; countries having less material wealth

Isn't public healthcare supposed to save wealth?

&gt; countries having more pressing mattters to attend to

US has more pressing matters.

&gt; countries having a different national mindset.

You mean pro public healthcare?

&gt; The world is a complex place and every input affects the output in one way or another.

US is a complex place and every input affects the output in one way or another.

&gt; *2. The point was if you can get the same service from the government for a lower price you come out ahead. There's not some magical economic principle that money spent on taxes is somehow counts more than money spent somewhere else.

By that logic government should nationalize everything and provide all services cheaper.

&gt; *3. I'm not a psycologist but it probably has something to do with sharing the cost. You know how if you go to a reatsraunt to eat and your going to split the bill people order more expensive food than you might have otherwise because the amount you pay isn't really going to be affected by how much you spend as much as it will be by how much everyone else spends so you might as well enjoy yourself? I'd imagine whatever principle is responsible for that works the same with taxes.

That doesn't really work that way. With government run health-care everyone gets the same food. So you are paying exactly the same as on your own.

------------------------------------

I'm going to go through every part of this comic, point by point, and explain why it's wrong, OK?

First, George W. Bush (you know, our last ""President""?) actually personally knew the guys that ran Enron (see: ""Bushwhacked""), [and even received millions of dollars in ""campaign contributions"" from them](http://www.alternet.org/story/12155/).

But how does reddit react to the Tea Party?  Just look at this woman holding this sign:

http://www.whale.to/vaccines/IMG_5365.jpg

she wrote ""MERCURY POISONED"" instead of ""poisoned by mercury.""  Reddit will tell you her point is invalid, and we should stop caring that the government forced learning disabilities onto her children, because there's one sign in this whole [set of protest pictures](http://www.whale.to/vaccines/thimerosal.htm) that has a fucking typo in it.  They will tell you that the link between vaccines and autism is discredited (it isn't), and that you're paranoid for thinking otherwise.  They would demean the experience of all of these parents with children disabled by this disease, and say that their knowledge of what's happened to them is invalid, by pointing to a single news article which claims they're wrong.  

Fuck, reddit makes me so sick sometimes.   It has so much potential, if you people could just get over your goddamn [Stockholm Syndrome](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome).  The government is not your friend.  The government is your worst enemy.  The corporations are only as bad as they are because the government shut all their competition out of the market for them.

True,mcrbids,,,"It's far, far, worse than that. It's trivial to penetrate airport security if you are, in fact, a private pilot. All you have to do is *land*. Most people don't know this, but you don't need any special permission to land at *any* airport, only clearance to land at the larger ones. 

As a private pilot, the conversation goes something like this: 

**Pilot: ""Capital Tower, skyhawk November 1235 10 miles to the north with information"".** *Translation: Hey Sacramento Airport, I'm in a little plane with Plane license # 1235 10 miles north of you, and I've listened to the automated weather briefing"".* 

**Tower: ""Skyhawk 235, make straight in for 13 right, advice 2 miles final""** 
*Translation: Hey there little buddy, come on in, and let me know when you are gettin' close, ok?""* 

They have no way to check the tail number. I have called the wrong tail number accidentally, and even had the wrong number called back to me repeatedly. And once I land, I follow their taxi instructions and park. Then, I can get out of the plane and pretty much go.... wherever my feet take me. 

**Want to end the terrorist threat for good?** Have the US Govt excise a $10 tax on every passenger on a commercial flight. Have that fee waived for passengers who (A) Have passed a criminal background check, (B) passed a hunter's safety course, and (C) have a loaded gun on their person during the flight. Not only would this additional security actually reduce tax burden, and help balance the budget, it would actually *bring in revenue* for the government, while appeasing the far right who seem to really, really like the idea of guns and stuff, while simultaneously improving real security. 

When the bad guy realizes that 10-25% of the people aboard are packing, the game's over. It works like vaccines - those who aren't immediately protected are protected by those who are, and I'd happily pay $10 to know that my plane won't be hijacked...

""Similarities between the House and Senate Bills
The two bills are similar in a number of ways. In particular, both bills[124]:
- Mandate minimum health insurance benefits for most Americans

- Remove insurer set annual and lifetime caps on coverage and limit co-pay amounts

- Remove co-pays on certain services such as health screenings and some vaccinations
- Impose a new excise tax on medical devices and drugs, including vaccines[125][126] (the federal government began taxing vaccines in 1987[127]).
- Establish health insurance exchanges making easier price and coverage comparisons and purchasing for people and small businesses buying health care coverage
- Prevent insurers selling in the exchange insurance policies that do not meet minimum coverage standards
- Prevent insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing health conditions
- Prevent sex discrimination by insurers (especially the current discrimination against women) in setting premiums
- Limit age discrimination by insurers when setting policy premiums
- Restrict the ability of insurers to rescind policies they have been collecting premiums on
- Require insurers to cover adult children up to their mid twenties as part of family coverage
- Expand Medicaid eligibility up the income ladder (to 133% of the poverty line in the Senate bill and 150% in the House bill)
- Offer tax credits to certain small businesses (under 25 workers) who provide employees with health insurance
- Impose a penalty on employers who do not offer health insurance to their workers
- Impose a penalty on individuals who do not have health insurance (except American Indians (currently covered by the Indian Health Service), people with religious objections and people who can show financial hardship)
- Provide health insurance assistance subsidies for those earning up to 400% of the federal poverty level that must buy insurance for themselves
- Offer a new voluntary long-term care insurance program
- Pay for new spending, in part, through cutting over-generous funding (under existing law) given to private insurers that sell privatised health care plans to seniors (so called - Medicare Advantage plans), slowing the growth of Medicare provider payments[citation needed], reducing Medicare and Medicaid drug prices[citation needed], cutting other - Medicare and Medicaid spending through better reward structures, and raising taxes on very generous health care packages (typically offered to senior executives) and - penalties on larger firms not providing their employees with health care coverage and certain persons who do not buy health insurance.
Impose a $2,500 limit on contributions to a flexible spending account (FSAs), pre-tax health benefits, to pay for health care reform costs.""

True,mattj1,,,"I am an atheist. I love science, and I believe in modern medicine. I also believe that someone who does not believe in modern medicine is capable of reporting facts about a new medical advance or scientific discovery, even if they see no merit in participating in/purchasing/using said advancement. I will agree that this does bias them (maybe it causes laziness in reporting some facts, or it harms their ability to understand what they're reporting on), but does that mean they can't write down quotes from a scientist? Are they incapable of explaining the statistical significance of a new finding? If they are as true to journalism as they claim, then they can report on anything as accurately as anyone else, as long as they at least attempt to put their own biases aside. That's a lot more than can be said for many other popular publications, and on both sides of the heated modern political spectrum.

I read dozens of other news sources a day, and with all the common stories that come up each day, they have a slightly different take, just like every other publication out there. If I ever read anything in their paper that mentioned God, Christianity, or a disbelief in modern medicine, I would spend time analyzing possible reasons for these actions. If I determined that they were mentioning these things in order to endoctranate me with their opinions, that would be the last article I read in their paper. If they suggested a vaccine was a bad idea, that Christians are superior to Muslims, or that atheism is immoral, I would tell everyone to avoid them, and that they were not truly journalistic.

But look at the other comments here, realize that most of us just want to read news that attempts to deliver facts and expert opinions from professionals (i.e. doctors, scientists), and then allow us as the reader to develop an informed opinion of our own. Any of us would be fools to go to just one source for this information, and how naive we would be to ignore the fact that a newspaper has a religion in its name? But if that paper is open about its origins and funding even in name, they earn some credibility. If their stories are consistent with other sources, and they deliver compelling new stories about all advances, even those they don't personally believe in, then it seems to me that they have truth in mind, not deception.

Not everyone in this world is looking out for only themselves and their own opinion. Some people truly believe in such a thing as a fact, and honesty. You and I might see the world through a different lens, but we can both agree that a new cancer drug is 62% effective according to a peer reviewed study we both read. I can believe the universe is random and unknown, and you can believe that it has great and divine order, and yet we can both agree that animals clearly adapt at a genetic level and change over time. Some people get caught up in the first set of ideas they ever encounter, and another group of people understands that there is one common truth we all share, a fact based, empirically discovered reality. We all have both traits, and we must constantly fight against our programmed reality in order to see the true reality. If we can agree to report facts without opinion, and form opinions from fact, we may not form the same opinion, but we can empathize with one another.

[The Accomplishments of Liberalism](http://web.archive.org/web/20070914170855/http://www.cjnetworks.com/~cubsfan/libgood.html)

GI Bill

Labor Laws

era: 1930's-present
An end to child labor, 40 hour work weeks, the right of employees to collectively bargain, overtime pay, workplace safety, all of the things we take for granted today are thanks to liberal laws passed in the first half of this century. It was the conservatives who fought tooth and nail against the end of sweatshops and exploitation.


Environmental Laws

era: 1970's-present
The environment has gotten much better in the last 30 years thanks to liberals. Bald Eagles fly once again thanks to endangered species laws, most rivers and lakes are clean again due to anti-pollution laws, and frequent smog days are a thing of the past in most big American cities.


Food safety laws

era: 1910's-present
Ever read Sinclair's ""The Jungle?"" That's what things were really like before food purity laws were on the books. Today cases of food poisoning are rare, and consumers know that whatever they buy is safe to eat.


Workplace safety laws

era: 1930's-present
Long hours in unsafe conditions are much rarer today than in the past. Tragedies such as the Triangle Shirtwaist fire and child labor have been eliminated by liberal and progressive legislation.


Social Security

era: 1930's-1970's
This program has provided three generations of Americans retirement benefits, and nearly eliminated poverty among the elderly. The program is weakening now, but for 50 years it did its job to a T.


Economic Growth

era: 1950's-1960's
Liberalism and economic prosperity go hand-in-hand. Unlike the pseudo-boom of the 1980's, the 1950's and 1960's were a period of sustained and real growth for all sectors of the economy and all social classes. Taxes were fair, government worked, and America prospered under both Democratic and Republican administrations


Space Program

era: 1950's-present
It was Kennedy who challenged us to make it to the moon, and it is under his and Johnson's administrations that the space program took off, with numerous benefits to American industry and peoples' standard of living, not to mention national pride. If you are reading this on a computer, thank the space program and the liberals who got it going.


Peace corps

era: 1960's-present
Kennedy inspired thousands of Americans to ask what they could do for their country, and the Peace Corps is his most visible and effective legacy


Civil rights movement

era: 1950's-present
Liberal ideals drove the biggest change in American society since the Civil War, the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s. All Americans who believe in freedom and opportunity cannot help but be inspired by the valiant struggles of MLK and others. Also recall if you will that the major opponents of civil rights were conservatives.


The fight against Totalitarianism

era: always
World War II was fought by all Americans; liberals and conservatives fought together the evil of Nazism. The ideal we fought for was freedom and the dignity of the individual against totalitarianism. Under the leadership of Roosevelt and Truman, we won. But the battle is never over, so we must remain vigilant.


The Internet

era: 1960's-present
Not a liberal program per se, but rather a government one, which many equate as the same thing. The internet is a good example of what a government program can do when allowed to work.


The Tennessee Valley project

era: 1930's
The Depression-era government program bought electricity to thousands of impoverished families in Appalachia, prevented floods, and created thousands of new jobs.


Women's right to vote

era: 1920's-present
Before 1920, half of America's population could not exercise the essential duty of citizenship.


Universal Public Education

era: 1890's-present
The reason America is so strong economically is because we have a well-educated citizenry. Public schooling is the true melting pot of America, where every student, regardless of economic background can be taught the basics of citizenship. It is no coincidence that in the last 20 years, as conservatives have greatly weakened the public school system, that American students have scored lower on tests and our civic society has started to unravel.


National Weather Service

era: 1930's-present
This is one of those things you never think about, but you are glad its there. Far from just forecasting the weather, the NWS also provides vital data to pilots and sailors, and the NWS satellites and observation posts provide the raw data that all other weather forecasting services (private ones too!) depend on.


Scientific Research

era: 1940's-present
Much of the great discoveries in science have come about through grants from the government. This is not to say that scientific genius depends on Washington, but the fact remains that pure science is expensive, and private industry will often not fund experiments which don't have a direct commercial potential. From Salk's polio vaccine to todays Human Genome Project and Hubble Space Telescope, the government is an important partner in scientific discovery.


Product Labeling/Truth in Advertising Laws

era: 1910's-present
""We take it for granted that if a claim is made publicly for a product, it's reasonable to assume it's true. Plus, every time we check the ingredients on a can or package of food, we should mentally call down blessings on the liberals who passed the necessary legislation over the anguished howls of the conservatives, who were convinced such info would be prohibitively expensive, and too big a burden on business.""


Public Health

era: 1910's-present
Government funded water and sewage systems are an important part of modernity. In addition, organizations such as the National Institute of Health and the Center for Disease Control play an important part in maintaining the national health and preventing epidemics through research, vaccination programs, etc.


Morrill Land Grant Act

era: late 1800's
This act is the reason why nearly every state in the Union has a large public university. These centers of learning have educated untold millions of Americans. If you went to a school with a state name in it, then you were helped by liberalism.


Rural Electrification

era: 1930's-1960's
This allowed remote, rural areas of the country the basic convinience of electricity. I am sure that those of us using computers on the internet, sitting in our air conditioned homes, under our electric lights consider electricity a basic necessity - one that the pure market would never have found profitable to provide to isolated farming communities.


Public Universities

era: 1890's-present day
Put a college education within the reach of nearly every American. In addition to education, many of these institutions have played key roles in all kinds of scientific research and been a strong influence on our entire society.


Bank Deposit Insurance

era: 1930's-present day
About 1934, as part of extensive New Deal banking legislation, Congress created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to provide federal insurance for bank deposits.Ã This was instrumental in restoring confidence in our nation's banks, and remains so to this day.


Earned Income Tax Credit

era: 1970's-present day
Reduces the tax burden for working families who make under $28,500.00 You have to earn income to get it. It is not a handout. It's a great incentive for families to stay off welfare. But the atmosphere has changed in Washington, and Republicans had to find a way to pay for their capital-gains tax cut, and EITC was their ticket to success. So, the Republicans voted to cut this program by $29 billion over a certain time frame. Well guess what? They just raised the taxes on lower income working families.


Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

era: 1940's-present day
The world's foremost authority and defense against infectious disease and epidemic is a department of the United States government.


Family and Medical Leave Act

era: 1993-present day
This is a program which mandates that you have the right to job leave to take care of sick family members, or to have a child. Many conservatives were opposed to this valuable piece of legislation. Perhaps they were opposed to family values?


Consumer Product Safety Commission

era: 1972-present day
These guys regulate consumer products for safety. Everything from sharp (and edible) baby toys to flammable pjamas have been taken off the market due to the work of this commission.


Public Broadcasting

era: 1930's-present day
Millions of our children have learned from shows like Sesame Street, 3-2-1 Contact, and Mister Rogers (and so many more). Millions of adults continue to learn from shows like Nova. Also, the best broadcast journalism is by far National Public Radio. PBS and NPR have served to enrich our national culture.


Americans With Disabilities Act

era: 1990-present day
Civil rights for disabled citizens. It is fair, just, and it is the law of the land. Credit where credit is due, former Senator Bob Dole helped push this through, a rare nod in favor of liberalism from Mr. Dole.

The closest you could get to arguing money to religious charities is the application of Lemon laws- but the government gives money to charities of *all* religious backgrounds, which means that no one religion is established or advantaged; preventing money from being used for proselytizing ensures that the government's purpose is secular, something which *was* previously missing.

The problem with federal money to religiously aligned charities, the problem which this executive order seeks to fix, is that religion-based charities operating at home and abroad (most importantly abroad) tend to alienate the people they are attempting to help when they begin to proselytize. Christian organizations distributing vaccines while preaching about Jesus in non-Christian areas in the third-world often cause mistrust and an unwillingness to accept the charity due to their preaching.

True,Wordie,,,"&gt;In other words, no matter what kind of system you establish, there will always be some who - by virtue of ability, social connections, etc. - will have disproportionate influence within that system. This is unavoidable; every system of rules will have some combinations of inputs that lead to local optima. If you attempt to overcome this by creating new rules to shift the system away from its current equilibrium, you create a new equilibrium, except this time, it is entrenched with de jure rules, and even harder to overcome.

A very insightful statement, but nevertheless, I still believe that we need to *continually* make the effort to restrain the influence of those who will try to use their societal advantages solely for their own benefit. It will never, as you note, be a done deal, but in each new circumstance we must respond to the new threats.

To make a long and sad story short: The concentrated power of corporate persons has overwhelmed our democratic system. The unsound decisions of our unchecked and unbalanced Supreme Court have handed the âkeys to the Kingdomâ over to our corporate overlords. An analogy with an AIDS infection is instructive: After 1886, our democratic âimmune systemâ resisted Davisâ corporate personhood infection of our national body politic by deploying the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, the Progressive Movement, the Labor Movement, and the New Deal. All of these bought time. But now, in the era of global mega-corporations, after a long struggle, our âdemocratic immune systemâ is finally being overwhelmed. Democracy, rule of, by, and for the people, is dying in America.

I think the metaphor of inoculation is a good one. And we'll have to keep developing new anti-corporate-greed-vaccines in the form of laws forever, basically, because the greed virus, as you note, will keep mutating.

True,Pugilanthropist,,,"That's like arguing which came first, the chicken or the egg.

Do universities have more of a liberal outlook because they're biased or are universities more liberal because higher education leads to liberal thought?   I think you could make a substantial argument for both points of view.

Myself, I was a pretty strong fiscal conservative until I started paying attention to world events on a global scale.   That's when I realized I would much rather place my general good in the hands of the government(which is, by definition, accountable and transparent) versus corporations(neither of the above, and don't even start with the free market arguments because I'll shoot them down with countering evidence so quickly it'll make your head spin).   So in my particular instance, education turned me liberal, becoming a business owner made me conservative, and then learning about life on a holistic scale made me liberal again.   This is why I can articulate conservative arguments better than most conservatives, I suspect.   I've been there, and I've turned the corner through continued education(if not in the institutional sense).

&gt;Let me know when you have that great job.

This isn't really about me as much as it is about philosophy majors on the whole. Though, with my 4.0 and honors society membership, along with numerous scholarships, I'm not that worried and neither should you be. The fact that they get high LSAT scores means they get into good law schools, which means they get jobs that I hear pay pretty well. Getting a grad degree, no matter what it is, bumps up your average pay as well.

&gt;Philosophy majors are great at arguing about nothing,

The irony is that this itself is a philosophical argument. 

&gt;studying carefully how to best use mental gymnastics to prove their point.

Not sure how that is a criticism. Using mental gymnastics sounds like mental agility, which sounds like something I would enjoy employing.

&gt; It's quantitative skills that move the world forward in scientific advancement

It is both quantitative and qualitative working together actually. Sure scientists invented the polio vaccine, but who got it wasn't decided by scientists. It was decided by politicians, economists, philosophers, and others that are not scientists.

&gt;Engineers and scientists discover and build the future, philosophers just argue about it.

This statement acts like arguing about it isn't an important part of the process. Plenty of scientists proposed eugenics as the cure for social ills. If it wasn't for arguing about this belief, Steven Hawking might not have been able to do the scientific work that he has done. He would be dead for being genetically inferior.

Also, you will find that many philosophers were mathematicians and scientists themselves. I think the Cartesian coordinate system is named such for some guy that thought about things really hard. I think Aristotle is the father of logic, and I think logicians paved the road for computer science.

Here's the end of the argument for me: You cannot escape philosophy. You and me and everybody else will engage in it inevitably. I'm sure you've argued for some political position, likely on the internet even. What are you arguing? If you argue a libertarian standpoint, that your labor should belong to you and you should not be forced to give it up against your will, then John Locke has already said everything you're going to say three hundred years ago.

Maybe you believe the opposite, you believe a Marxist doctrine of ""to each according to need."" Well, then you're definitely dabbling in philosophy. The man wrote extensively about Hegel, another philosopher.

Even when you play a video game and say that it looks pretty, but the controls suck you're engaging in philosophical discussion about aesthetics. When you say that you respect an athlete for telling the truth about steroids, even though it cost him his career, you're just a regular Socrates.

Philosophy is absolutely inescapable. You will participate in numerous philosophical discussions throughout your life, but given the inductive evidence I've gathered in talking to you, you will do it poorly because you lack the skill of using the tool properly.

You can also be grandiose about your chosen profession, but your average scientist and engineer is simply ""building the future"" that others are telling them to build. Frequently building the future that has been laid out by politicians, CEOs, and others that very well might have degrees in communications, law, and other humanities.

Fluoride was a public health gold mine as it made water safe to drink.  And at the levels in our drinking water, it's not toxic to anything near the scale of humans.  At least not with the data that has been collected in the 50-odd years that it's been going on in the US.  Perfectly safe if you're not a microbe.

Anti-vaccine people are some of the most willfully ignorant folks on the planet.  When presented with mountains of evidence to the contrary, they cling to ancient, methodologically flawed studies like a drowning man to a life raft.

True,Abraxas65,,,"&gt;Oh yes I di-iid. My concern isn't that the drugs don't do anything. Of course they help counteract the diseases you mentioned (like lipitor, plaxiv, nexuium). But the way the pharmaceutical industry is constructed is that if there was a cure, the drug company would be out of business. I'm not going to pretend to be a biochemist, but it is apparent that the way things are structured is for the bureaucracy to perpetuate itself. If there were cures, people wouldn't have to be on these drugs for a lifetime.

I'm sorry but biology and medicine dont work how you think it does.  For most disease you can't just cure them with a pill, its not physically possible.  The only disease you can really cure are bacterial/fungal infections, certain viral infections, short term inflammatory responses, antihistime reactions and cancer (might be a few others that I cant think of right now). 

 Other disease such as HTN, diabetes, etc can occasionally be cured by changing ones lifestyle (some ppl get screwed genetically and there is nothing they can do to keep from getting these disease).  We know that being over weight, eating fatty foods and eating too much salt adversely effects your blood pressure, if you stop doing these things your body can and usually will start regulating your blood pressure properly and it will come down.  But just because you can ""cure"" the disease with lifestyle changes doesn't mean you can take a pill and get the same results, biology doesnt work this way.  These diseases are caused by very complex interactions of many different stimuli, while we can occasionally deal with the symptoms of these diseases (ie give a diabetic insulin) we can not cure them with a pill (one day maybe in a hundred years we might but not anytime soon).

Diseases such as ADD/ADHD, Type I diabetes and Autism can **not be ""cured""** short of genetically altering the patient.  Diseases of this sort result from a fundamental process in the body not working correctly due to either toxin exposure or genetics.  The only way to cure this is to either not let the toxin exposure happen (this might work for reducing autism but no one knows for sure) or to change the actual genetics of the patient so that the process that doesn't work is fixed, it is not possible to just give a person a pill and cure these diseases.

I would like to point out that this 
&gt;But the way the pharmaceutical industry is constructed is that if there was a cure, the drug company would be out of business.

is completely untrue and I can prove it by point to antibiotics and vaccines which or two of the few drugs that can ""cure"" a person and are still able to generate large profits.  You make a mistake in assuming that just because you cure someone that the disease wont come back and/or the disease wont develop a resistance to your cure.

&gt;Besides, in the case of amphetamines, everybody is better with a little speed.

This is simply untrue, while I believe that ADD/ADHD are over diagnosed doesn't change the fact that their are ppl who actually suffer from these diseases.  While these medications are given to certain ppl in professions it isn't done so because it makes them work better, it is given so that they can work longer not better.  It is done for either logistical reasons and/or profit, not because they can do their jobs better and this misuse (IMO) of the medication doesn't take away from its benefit when used properly.

&gt;the side-effects are more dangerous than the disease they treat

This is usually a matter of opinion and is best left to the patient who should be adequately informed of the known risks by their physician and pharmacists.

&gt;They influence legislation. I use them as an example because they are large and well known, and spend a lot of money on lobbying. I do not think corporations should have a say in this.

That makes sense.

&gt; Beck has at times spoken against violence, but he more often forecasts it, warning that ""it is only a matter of time before an actual crazy person really does something stupid."" Most every broadcast has some violent imagery: ""The clock is ticking. . . . The war is just beginning. . . . Shoot me in the head if you try to change our government. . . . You have to be prepared to take rocks to the head. . . . The other side is attacking. . . . There is a coup going on. . . . Grab a torch! . . . Drive a stake through the heart of the bloodsuckers. . . . They are taking you to a place to be slaughtered. . . . They are putting a gun to America's head. . . . Hold these people responsible.""

&gt; Beck has prophesied darkly to his millions of followers that we are reaching ""a point where the people will have exhausted all their options. When that happens, look out."" One night on Fox, discussing the case of a man who killed 10 people, Beck suggested such things were inevitable. ""If you're a conservative, you are called a racist, you want to starve children,"" he said. ""And every time they do speak out, they are shut down by political correctness. How do you not have those people turn into that guy?""

&gt; Today's outburst came in the middle of a hypothetical scenario Beck developed, one in which the government would consider taking his children because he refused to have them receive a mandatory flu vaccine. Beck explained to the audience that his response to such a claim would be to ""meet Mr. Smith and Mr. Wesson,"" a reference to the gun manufacturer.

&gt; On his Fox News show, Beck quoted a letter by Thomas Jefferson warning that "" 'if they lose freedom' -- he's speaking of us, future generations -- 'if they lose freedom, there will be rivers of blood.' "" Beck continued in his own words, ""Boy, I hope that's not true, but I can tell you there will be rivers of blood if we don't have values and principles.""

&gt; On his March 30, 2009, Fox News show, Beck aired a graphic portraying Obama and Democrats as vampires and said: ""The government is full of vampires, and they are trying to suck the lifeblood out of the economy."" Beck then suggested ""driv[ing] a stake through the heart of the bloodsuckers."" Beck returned to that imagery on his January 19 radio show, warning listeners that progressives are ""vampires"" who now have a ""taste of blood"" and are ""gonna start getting more and more violent.""

Most of the stuff I have a problem with, however, are his warnings about violence from the left. There are literally dozens of examples. Personally, I think all the ""warnings"" from violence coming from the left are completely unwarranted and scary to a lot of folks; they perceive they are under attack.  Glenn Beck has been issuing prophetic warnings about how liberals are literally planning and plotting to violently overthrow the U.S. In reality, this just stirs people up into a reactionary frenzy -- for no damn good reason. What do you do when you're think you're under violent attack? Defend yourself with violence. This is why I believe Glenn Beck's rhetoric is dangerous.

Some examples:

&gt; Beck suggested that Obama would respond to potential GOP victories in November elections by ""going right directly"" to the ""most progressive, most violent, the worst of the worst on the left and stir 'em up. 'Get out into the streets. Cause trouble.' It's what's coming. It's what's coming.""

[Source](http://mediamatters.org/mmtv/201009140009)


&gt; Beck warned listeners that ""if you don't think violence is coming, I'm going to share some audio of Frances Fox Piven that will boggle your mind."" Beck said that ""they don't mind violence. Violence will come. And violence will come from the left. Violence is part of the plan. Not mine, not yours."" 

[Source](http://mediamatters.org/mmtv/201009130014)

&gt; Urging people to vote in the November elections, Beck said that ""in the short term"" this election is ""going to make things worse"" because ""revolutionaries"" are going to ""rise up"" and ""set our streets on fire."" He added that ""our future is at stake right now.

Actually, that would be the tens of thousands you pay annually in premiums. Never mind the fact that you don't seem to understand... if you go in there with insurance, that's the theater they play with the insurance company and is not indicative of the real price.

&gt; It's an insane racket. I don't know in which country you get only 2x,

Ugh. I'm in the US. I was working a job where I had no insurance, and my recently born daughter needed those firstfew checkups and vaccinations. This wasn't 30 years ago, it was earlier this year. When you tell them that you're paying in cash, they tell you who to talk to in billing. I paid less than half. 

So, where you think the ""amount billed"" was 975, I would have paid $300 or $400 probably. But if you say that the insurance company ultimately (and routinely) paid $175, then I expect I would have been told the same. And I wouldn't have been shelling out whatever in the hell it is you pay each month in premiums. They don't hate people who pay in cash... those people mean that they don't spend salaries on people in the billing dept. fucking with the insurance company. It's cheaper to treat me than it is you with insurance. It's cheaper for me too, because I'm not paying $1000 a month just to get routine care that retails for a fifth of that.

I feel like it's just the liberal side of what Lou Dobbs did with his North American Union/Amero crap, or the climategate nonsense.

And of course a lot of conspiracy theories believe what they believe because of psychological reasons.  I don't mean because of schizophrenia or anything like that, but the fact that it feeds our ego when we feel like we know something that the ignorant masses don't, that we're *smarter*.  I felt this way when I first saw Loose Change...and then I looked into their arguments some more, and realized that it just really doesn't hold up, not when you actually take into account expert opinion.

I see this with Glenn Beck, Lou Dobbs, Billo, Truthers, vaccine conspiracists, Scientologists (which basically started out as anti-intellectualism against psychologists/psychiatrists), etc.

I think it's fair to say no-one intends to need medical care. I'll assume you mean you expect to always have medical insurance... in which case, I'd point to the case of the person in the article.

Better arguments:

Herd immunity. There's a growing problem in the UK of flu, due to relatively poor levels of vaccination this winter ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-12052816 ), which is at least partially blamed on no advertising campaign, leading to a rapidly increasing number of cases of flu ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-12061484 ).

Reduced costs of early treatment. Assuming that you're not intending on scrapping medicaid, you're leaving people with an odd position where it makes sense to leave something untreated until it's urgent enough to go to hospital.

Safety net. For the same reason that there is unemployment benefit, it provides a safety net, which allows people to take risks. Lets say I decide I want to start my own business; without guaranteed health care it's riskier than I think is necessary, and I can only hope I don't become ill.

Overall cost; while UK taxes are higher, medical costs (even just for insurance) in the US seem significantly higher than the difference (okay if we use http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/graphic/2010/12/11/GR2010121100050.html?sid=ST2010121006920 as an estimate?) Essentially, in how the US system is set up, you appear to be increasing what you're paying, in order to reduce coverage.

I should say, I don't think changing to an NHS equivalent will magically fix everything overnight, and will probably mean higher costs in the short term, but in the medium-long term I think you'd get substantially reduced costs.",0,1293572177,,0,True,0,c1amkcs,t3_esmlf,t1_c1amkcs,t1_c1am0s9,,1426658044,2,False,politics,t5_2cneq,2

People with cancer, heart disease, kidney disease, strokes, diabetes, and many other illness and conditions died, relatively quickly.  This was because there were no, or few, effective treatments 80 years ago.

* First cardiac bypass was in 1960

* First MRI medical imaging was in the 1970s

* First ultrasound imaging was in the late 1940s, but not widely available until the late 1970s

* Chemotherapy for cancer didn't exist until the 1940s, and didn't become effective for decades

There wasn't effective treatment for many bacterial infections 70 years ago, penicillin wasn't available for use until after 1945.
